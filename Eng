NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_2|||[m:happy]Scared you didn't I?
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_3|||[m:default]I know how scary a buzzword like science can be these days...
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_4|||[m:happy]But trust me when I say,
science can actually be a good thing sometimes.
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_5|||[m:default]Take this table for instance.
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_6|||A science made this table
and the floor it sits on!
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_7|||[m:whispering]There are even people out there who believe that a science made you and I!
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_8|||[m:default]But I digress,
the point I was trying to make here is that cats are a science too...
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_9|||[m:winking]A science that I

invented!
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_10|||[m:default]But what do you have to do with all of this?
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_11|||[m:default]Well, word on the street is you're a bit of a felineologist yourself.
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_12|||[m:happy]I know we just met, but I bet if you and I put our brains together we could actually change the world!
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_13|||[m:veryhappy][s:1.5][a:wave]WITH CATS![/a][/s]

This is my latest batch! Straight out of their biovats!

NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_19|||[m:sad]Isn't nature just cruel...
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_20|||[m:happy]But it doesn't have to be!
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_21|||[m:pondering]In fact, I think with my brains and your ability to choose less than ideal cats...
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_22|||[m:veryhappy]We could really shake things up!
NPC_BEANIES_INTRO_23|||[m:happy]Hell, with enough cats I bet we could reverse time!
Maybe even make dying impossible!?

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MAGICMIRROR_2|||[m:confused]Honestly I didn't think that was even possible...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MAGICMIRROR_3|||[m:pondering]hmmm..
The mirror appears to have fixed itself.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MAGICMIRROR_4|||[m:shocked]And a soul is trapped inside it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MAGICMIRROR_5|||[m:veryhappy]I'm a freakin' genius!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MAGICMIRROR_6|||[m:happy]Come back after you send more cats!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHAOSDEVICE_1|||[m:happy]I GOT ANOTHER ONE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHAOSDEVICE_2|||This invention may be my best yet!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHAOSDEVICE_3|||[m:default]I found these old knitting needles in your house before I revived you.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHAOSDEVICE_4|||[m:pondering]I'm pretty sure if you stab these things into the right areas of a brain...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHAOSDEVICE_5|||[m:default]The user can access past lives!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHAOSDEVICE_6|||[m:questioning]It's currently just theoretical... but we all know I'm never wrong.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHAOSDEVICE_7|||[m:default]Give it a test run. Just stab them in a cat's head and get them to finish {questdestination}.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHAOSDEVICE_1|||[m:happy]So, how was it?
Did the subject access their ancestor's ancient abilities?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHAOSDEVICE_2|||[m:default]Told ya!
Anyway I found a much cleaner set of needles and refined the item a bit.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHAOSDEVICE_3|||Take it. Oh, and here are those {questreward} coins I promised![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHAOSDEVICE_1|||[m:angry]Well this sure as hell wasn't my fault!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHAOSDEVICE_2|||Obviously you pushed the needles in too far or something...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHAOSDEVICE_3|||[m:veryangry]And you better not report this to the county!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHAOSDEVICE_4|||[m:paranoid]I'm already being monitored by the feds about my human cloning operation...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHAOSDEVICE_5|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHAOSDEVICE_6|||[m:default]Whatever, I forgive you.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MESTONE_1|||[m:veryhappy]IT'S TIME TO UNVEIL THE "ME STONE!"
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MESTONE_2|||[m:default]This invention will literally suck the successes of others and funnel it straight into the owner!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MESTONE_3|||[m:happy]Best part is, if everyone else is a failure, you look like an even bigger winner compared to them!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MESTONE_4|||[m:default]Go test it out.
Uh, try taking it through {questdestination} this time.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MESTONE_5|||Let me know how it goes!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MESTONE_1|||[m:default]Nice!
Guess it all worked out fine.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MESTONE_2|||[m:whispering]Now let me let you in on a little secret...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MESTONE_3|||[m:paranoid]That stone not only removed the success of your other cats...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MESTONE_4|||[m:happy]But it also drained their joy! It's all right there in the stone now!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MESTONE_5|||[m:happy]Pretty clever huh?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MESTONE_6|||[m:questioning]And by the looks of the stone, those cats are running on empty!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MESTONE_7|||[m:default]Anyway, you can have it and the {questreward} coin reward.[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MESTONE_1|||[m:angry]Well look who's back!
It's the idiot!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MESTONE_2|||[m:veryangry]SHAME! SHAME DOUBLE SHAME!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MESTONE_3|||NOW LEAVE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANGRYFACE_1|||[m:default]Check out this mask I made.  I've been working with paper mache in my downtime.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANGRYFACE_2|||[m:pondering]Actually.. wanna test it out?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANGRYFACE_3|||[m:default]I drew an angry face on it, so obviously it will turn the cat that wears it into a total psycho.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANGRYFACE_4|||If you can get the cat wearing it to the end of {questdestination}, I'll hook you up.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANGRYFACE_1|||[m:happy]Very nice work!
Look at us doing science together!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANGRYFACE_2|||[m:default]But check this out, while you were gone I made another mask!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANGRYFACE_3|||[m:happy]This time I did a happy face.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANGRYFACE_4|||[m:winking]That is the emotion you feel when you make money.

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ANGRYFACE_2|||[m:veryangry]Do you know how long I spent on that thing!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ANGRYFACE_3|||[m:angry]Those eyebrows took ages to get just right!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ANGRYFACE_4|||[m:veryangry]GAAAAH!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FARTFACE_1|||[m:happy]Fart Face!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FARTFACE_2|||Yep,
I've invented "Fart Face"!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FARTFACE_5|||[m:veryhappy]HAHAHAHA!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FARTFACE_6|||[m:happy]It's so nasty, Stacy was dry heaving the whole night I was making it!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FARTFACE_1|||[m:veryhappy]HAHAHA!!!!
You actually did it!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FARTFACE_2|||[m:mocking]That was a joke! I didn't really expect you to do it...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FARTFACE_3|||[m:happy]Whatever, good work I guess?

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FARTFACE_1|||[m:happy]Hahaha!
Well someone needs a class on social cues...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FARTFACE_2|||I was obviously joking about that little side quest...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FARTFACE_3|||[m:mocking]It was called Fart Face...
How could you think I was serious?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FARTFACE_4|||[m:angry]I'm a scientist doing real science stuff, not some street walker with a fart fetish!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_1|||[m:happy]INVENTION TIME!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_2|||[m:questioning]You know those tiny spiders you've seen on adventures?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_3|||[m:default]I found a way to put them into a tube thing, that injects 'em straight into your brain!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_4|||[m:pondering]My theory is you can gain super powers from their bites!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_5|||[m:default]I got the idea from that guy that the kids go nuts for, he dresses in a costume and shoots sticky stuff...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_6|||[m:pondering]What's his name again?... Something Jackson?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_7|||[m:default]Doesn't matter. Just at least finish {questdestination} so they have time to hatch!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_SPIDERINJECTOR_8|||[m:happy]So excited about this one!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_SPIDERINJECTOR_1|||[m:veryhappy]SUCCESS!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_SPIDERINJECTOR_2|||[m:happy]You did great out there!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_SPIDERINJECTOR_3|||[m:default]Your cats will all no doubt perish from infection, but it's for the betterment of humanity as a whole.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_SPIDERINJECTOR_4|||Because now we know spiders living in your brain isn't a good thing.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_SPIDERINJECTOR_5|||[m:pondering]Well I mean, it might work if it were fleas... Yeah, or maggots?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_SPIDERINJECTOR_6|||[m:questioning]...
Gotta find something to write this down on.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_SPIDERINJECTOR_7|||[m:default]Oh, before you go here's {questreward} coins, and you can keep the brain spiders...
They are on the house![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_SPIDERINJECTOR_4|||[m:angry]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_SPIDERINJECTOR_5|||You are lucky I installed that chip in your brain...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_SPIDERINJECTOR_6|||Imagine if I just ate it instead, you'd be as dumb as dirt!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_SPIDERINJECTOR_7|||[m:veryangry]GO!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_1|||[m:happy]Guess whose
birthday it is?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_2|||[m:veryhappy]STACY!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_3|||[m:pondering]Well technically

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_4|||[m:default]The original Stacy was born on August 19th...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_5|||[m:sad]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_6|||[m:confused]No, no...
That is in the past... [m:happy]Today we celebrate!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_7|||See this device? I call it the "Party Detonator"!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_8|||It causes anything that is downed to explode into a festive poof of colored confetti!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTYDETONATOR_9|||[m:default]Bring the party all the way through {questdestination} then come back for some cake!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTYDETONATOR_5|||And I modded that detonator into something a bit more functional, you can have it too.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTYDETONATOR_6|||[m:veryhappy]Now it's time to spank Stacy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTYDETONATOR_7|||[m:whispering]I've modified her DNA so technically she's somewhere around 136 years old.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTYDETONATOR_8|||[m:sad]I doubt she will survive this... But traditions are traditions!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTYDETONATOR_9|||[m:veryhappy]Let the spanking commence!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTYDETONATOR_1|||[m:veryangry]Well I hope you are happy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTYDETONATOR_2|||You ruined Stacy 34284's birthday party!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTYDETONATOR_3|||[m:angry]She was so upset she crawled into a hole and died!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTYDETONATOR_4|||[m:veryangry]And that is on YOU my friend!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTYDETONATOR_5|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTYDETONATOR_6|||Oh this thing?
[m:happy]This is Stacy 36127 obviously.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTYDETONATOR_7|||[m:whispering]Her birthday isn't for a few days...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AIRHORN_1|||[m:pondering]So I'm testing a theory with this horn...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AIRHORN_2|||[m:default]My theory is, if you are constantly alerting the enemy to where you are...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AIRHORN_3|||[m:shocked]They will ambush and kill you faster!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AIRHORN_4|||[m:happy]It's just a theory mind you, we need it tested and proven so I can officially take credit for it.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AIRHORN_5|||[m:winking]So uh, here, take this air horn! It's audible for miles, and annoying as hell!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AIRHORN_6|||[m:happy]Oh, and make sure the cat with the horn survives!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_1|||[m:happy]I knew it! I knew my theory was correct!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_2|||[m:winking]You know I came up with that theory when I was screaming at Stacy 3265...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_3|||[m:default]I was just unloading on her, my screeching was deafening.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_4|||[m:shocked]Stacy 3146 was so annoyed she freakin' attacked me!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_5|||[m:questioning]But how did she know where I was!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_6|||[m:happy]That's when I came up with the theory that sounds can alert others to your whereabouts!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_7|||[m:winking]Pretty interesting right? Science is like that sometimes!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_8|||[m:happy]Anyway, I'm having a very hard time hearing you right now because I've been working on a NEW air horn.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_9|||[m:veryhappy]I call it the
Super Airhorn!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AIRHORN_10|||[m:happy]It's REALLY annoying!
Here, take it.[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_1|||[m:shocked]They all died!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_2|||[m:pondering]Well my theory was correct then...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_3|||[m:default]But if you can't return the air horn, I can't consider this theory solved.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_4|||[m:questioning]I mean, how do I know you didn't just kill the cats yourself for the reward, right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_5|||[m:bored]Listen, I'm a scientist,
We have rules.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_6|||[m:angry]No fudging outcomes!
All theories must be tested and proven!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_7|||[m:pondering]We also have this other rule "First, do no harm".
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_8|||[m:angry]But that one is very outdated, and pretty damn stupid in my opinion...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_9|||[m:veryangry]Like, what if the whole point of my testing IS to do harm!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_10|||[m:angry]I didn't major in robotics to NOT make tiny robots that collect the genitals of living organisms!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_11|||[m:veryangry]It's totally insane!
Who even made that dumb rule up!?
Some old dead man, that's who!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_12|||[m:angry]I'm so pissed at you for screwing this up!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AIRHORN_13|||You better get your shit together ASAP unless you wanna wake up tomorrow with missing genitals!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NUCLEARKNIFE_1|||[m:happy]Oh man this one's super cool!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NUCLEARKNIFE_2|||[m:questioning]You know how nuclear power works right? Well, I made a knife that converts time into pure atomic energy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NUCLEARKNIFE_3|||[m:veryhappy]So you can just kick back and watch its power grow!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NUCLEARKNIFE_4|||[m:paranoid]...
But listen, you gotta let it kill stuff or it will turn on you.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NUCLEARKNIFE_5|||[m:winking]Nuclear power is a fickle mistress. Only the souls of the living can calm her fury!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NUCLEARKNIFE_6|||[m:pondering]So make sure you feed it, or it will probably explode or something.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NUCLEARKNIFE_7|||[m:bored]...
That's bad.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_1|||[m:veryhappy]YESSS!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_2|||[m:happy]Oh man, this invention will put us 50 years into the future!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_3|||[m:pondering]I can hear it now, the Nobel Peace Prize goes to....
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_4|||[m:veryangry][s:1.3]BOOM![/s] [s:1.1]
Dead![/s]
Everything dead!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_5|||[m:veryhappy]Hahaha!!
Hahaha!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_6|||[m:happy]Sorry, I just can't get that visual out of my head...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_7|||[m:veryhappy][s:1.3]BOOM![/s]
ONLY ASHES REMAIN!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_8|||[m:happy]Heh...
Guess you had to be there.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NUCLEARKNIFE_9|||[m:default]Here,
I made a gun with the same tech!
I call it Nuclear Gun!
Pretty neat huh?[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_1|||[m:angry]Oh you really messed up this time!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_2|||Now there is a goddamn hungry knife lying around somewhere ready to go off!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_3|||[m:veryangry]That's like leaving a loaded gun with a baby!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_4|||[m:pondering]Except the gun is really cool and the baby is some kind of robot Nazi!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_5|||[m:questioning]No wait, the baby is Hitler and the gun is ... like a train or something?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_6|||[m:angry]Hey listen I'm a doctor, not some idiot poet loser who leaves a nuclear knife just laying around!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_7|||[m:veryangry]Irresponsible!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_8|||You irresponsible, dimwitted cluck!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NUCLEARKNIFE_9|||[m:angry]GAH!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_1|||[m:questioning]You know how I cut the hands off of all the animals i catch stealing food?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_2|||[m:happy]Well my newest invention puts my hand collection to good use!
I call it Animal Hands!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_3|||[m:questioning]You know that come hither motion you do with your finger? That's called sign language. A universal language to both animal and man!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_4|||[m:default]I rigged up all these animal hands to do that motion when you pull this cord here...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_5|||[m:pondering]My theory is that at least one animal will understand and just waddle on over to you when you use it...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_6|||[m:paranoid]Oh, but they do replace your own hands...
Still working out the kinks.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_7|||[m:happy]Eh, you'll figure it out!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ANIMALHANDS_8|||[m:winking]Good luck!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_1|||[m:shocked]Oh, you did it huh? Honestly not what I expected...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_2|||[m:questioning]Well if you want a reward, all I got are these remaining animal hands...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_3|||[m:default]Let me just tape these things together and...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_4|||[m:veryhappy]Voila,
Super Animal Hands![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_5|||[m:happy]What a Handy invention!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_6|||[m:winking]I know you're always looking for a Hand out?
Well this one is a bit of a Hand-me-down!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_7|||[m:veryhappy]Hand crafted,
by yours truly. Don't worry, you're in good Hands!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_8|||[m:happy]Now Let me give you a Hand with showing yourself out...
No wait, I think you've got that covered!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_9|||[m:angry]What, are you Hand-icapped!?
Don't you know how to exit a room!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ANIMALHANDS_10|||[m:veryangry]GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ANIMALHANDS_1|||[m:bored]Yeah whatever, I wasn't super married to the idea anyway...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ANIMALHANDS_2|||[m:questioning]I mostly wanted to clear out that barrel of hands I had in the back.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ANIMALHANDS_3|||[m:grossedout]That room reeks!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THELONER_1|||[m:pondering]Ever just want to be alone?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THELONER_2|||[m:winking]Well I got a foolproof invention to solve that problem!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THELONER_3|||[m:happy]I'd explain what it does, but I think it's more fun if you just test it out and see how it works for yourself.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THELONER_4|||Tell me how it goes!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_1|||[m:happy]Isn't being single so refreshing?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_2|||Pretty neat invention, right?
Well check this out...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_3|||[m:pondering]Now if we just rub the serial number off the bottom...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_4|||[m:questioning]And draw a little II on the side...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_5|||[m:veryhappy]We get The Loner II!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_6|||[m:winking]Cooler looking, lightweight and totally untraceable!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_7|||[m:happy]Got one myself.
Carry it on me 24/7...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_8|||[m:angry]Maybe I'll show it to you one day.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THELONER_9|||[m:bored]...[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_1|||[m:shocked]You lost the gun...?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_2|||[m:paranoid]Listen, I don't even know who you are, let alone anything about a gun!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_3|||[m:angry]I don't deal in guns, bombs or anything else illegal for that matter!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_4|||[m:scared]I'm here all alone and you're really scaring me!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_5|||[m:veryangry]SOMEONE HELP! A CRAZY FAT LADY IS THREATENING ME!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_6|||SHE'S A LIAR! SHE'S GONE INSANE AND SHE'S TRYING TO BREAK INTO MY LAB!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_7|||[m:bored]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_8|||[m:paranoid]Listen, you better leave fast! The cops around here are total psychos!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_9|||[m:shocked]I saw them beat the hell out of a guy last week so bad he crapped his pants!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_10|||[m:sad]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_11|||[m:questioning]Also get this, were you aware that smearing feces on a police officer is a felony!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THELONER_12|||[m:angry]LEAVE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_GLASSCANNON_1|||[m:questioning]You know those t-shirt cannons people use at sporting events?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_GLASSCANNON_2|||[m:happy]I made one that shoots glass! I call it,
The Glass Cannon!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_GLASSCANNON_3|||[m:pondering]This one's a bit faulty, it's kinda just spraying glass shards out willy nilly...
But I still need it tested.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_GLASSCANNON_4|||[m:questioning]You wear shoes, right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_GLASSCANNON_1|||[m:happy]Damn, that was like that movie Die Hard!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_GLASSCANNON_2|||Those paws must look like ground beef!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_GLASSCANNON_3|||[m:veryhappy]Worth it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_GLASSCANNON_4|||[m:winking]Because, check this out!
I fixed the cannon...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_GLASSCANNON_5|||[m:bored]Turns out the fire button was just stuck down with dried blood...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_GLASSCANNON_6|||[m:default]Anyway, I marked it Fixed. Take it![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GLASSCANNON_1|||[m:angry]Oh look, it's the loser!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GLASSCANNON_2|||[m:veryangry]The loser who lost my cannon!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GLASSCANNON_3|||[m:angry]How can you lose an adventure when you have a freakin' cannon!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GLASSCANNON_4|||[m:questioning]Were you just snorting the glass or something?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GLASSCANNON_5|||[m:veryangry]UGH, why am I always stuck with the idiots!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GLASSCANNON_6|||[m:angry]Come back when you grow out that pinhead of yours!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STOPWATCH_1|||[m:paranoid]You know what time it is?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STOPWATCH_2|||[m:winking]Time to get a new watch!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STOPWATCH_3|||[m:happy]Here, take mine!
I call it,
The Stopwatch!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STOPWATCH_4|||[m:default]It's a little timer I invented to keep you on task!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STOPWATCH_5|||[m:happy]It gives you 5 seconds to do something, and if you don't, it just takes over your brain!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STOPWATCH_6|||[m:default]I think it will be very helpful!
Give it a try!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STOPWATCH_1|||[m:shocked]Wow, you look frazzled! What happened?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STOPWATCH_2|||[m:pondering]Oh yeah the stopwatch thing. Well I guess you tested it out then?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STOPWATCH_3|||[m:default]While you were gone, I discovered that if you just hold it upside down and click it...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STOPWATCH_4|||[m:shocked]It actually causes a time stutter! [m:winking]
That's science talk for an extra turn!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STOPWATCH_5|||[m:default]It still has its issues but never look a gift horse in the mouth, right!?[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STOPWATCH_1|||[m:veryangry]YOU BROKE IT!
I NEEDED THAT STOPWATCH!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STOPWATCH_3|||[m:paranoid]Guinness is going to be so disappointed when they get here next week!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STOPWATCH_4|||[m:veryangry]ARE YOU GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STOPWATCH_5|||NOW I GOTTA COUNT OUT LOUD LIKE A DAMN CAVEMAN!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STOPWATCH_6|||LEAVE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STOPWATCH_7|||[m:sad]1... 2... 3...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FIGLEAF_1|||[m:veryhappy]I INVENTED THE FIG LEAF!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FIGLEAF_2|||[m:winking]Put this baby on, and everyone's clothes just melt off!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FIGLEAF_3|||[m:happy]As naked as the day you were born!
Just like God intended!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FIGLEAF_4|||[m:pondering]Now my theory is, if you fight in the buff, like the Greeks, all your soft parts will take a real beating!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FIGLEAF_5|||[m:question]I've always assumed those hangy bits would get snagged on something when exposed during combat...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FIGLEAF_6|||[m:happy]And I set out to prove that theory!
With your help of course!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_FIGLEAF_7|||[m:default]Do a nude run to {questdestination} and update me on how it goes, OK?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FIGLEAF_1|||[m:winking]Well look at you, you nasty old thing!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FIGLEAF_2|||[m:happy]Haha, just giving you a hard time!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FIGLEAF_3|||[m:winking]Walking around like that, I assume everyone in town is having a hard time, if you get what I mean!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FIGLEAF_4|||[m:veryhappy]Hahaha!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_FIGLEAF_5|||[m:winking]Pervert!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FIGLEAF_1|||[m:angry]Good, I'm glad you failed, you pervert!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FIGLEAF_2|||Indecent exposure is a misdemeanor in this state... but for people like you I assume it's a felony!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FIGLEAF_3|||[m:veryangry]Listen, I consider my office a judgemet free zone... but seriously, you can't just go pushing your lifestyle in everyone's faces!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FIGLEAF_4|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FIGLEAF_5|||[m:veryangry]Hey I didn't TELL you to do anything!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FIGLEAF_6|||[m:angry]I asked!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_FIGLEAF_7|||[m:veryangry]NOW LEAVE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DISEASEJAR_1|||[m:happy]Looky what I got for you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DISEASEJAR_2|||[m:winking]It's a jar of diseases!
Almost all of 'em I think...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DISEASEJAR_3|||[m:default]And by the way those organisms are crawling all over each other, there's gotta be a few new ones in there too!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DISEASEJAR_4|||[m:questioning]Now I just need you to hold on to it for a bit, at least 'till my rash clears up.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DISEASEJAR_5|||[m:pondering]Just take it to {questdestination}, or whatever.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DISEASEJAR_6|||[m:veryhappy]By the time you are back it should be filled to the brim with pustulating plagues!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DISEASEJAR_7|||[m:happy]So exciting!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_DISEASEJAR_6|||How could you do this to me!? I've raised those diseases since they were children!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_DISEASEJAR_7|||[m:angry]I should have known someone like you should never be in charge of a child!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_DISEASEJAR_9|||[m:veryangry]LEAVE MY SIGHT IMMEDIATELY!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HARDPILL_1|||[m:shocked]Look what I found at a random truck stop!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HARDPILL_2|||[m:questioning]It's all in Spanish but I'm pretty sure the word in all caps means HARD.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HARDPILL_3|||[m:pondering]And that word is all over the packaging so I assume it's going to make things quite hard for you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HARDPILL_4|||[m:happy]But I know you are up for a challenge! Go ahead and take that mysterious pill to {questdestination}.

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_HARDPILL_4|||[m:happy]Here... you can take the pill!
I don't really need it.

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HARDPILL_2|||[m:question]Whatever, I didn't need it anyway!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HARDPILL_3|||[m:angry]And don't you go spreading any rumors about me either!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HARDPILL_4|||[m:bored]All I need is for the few remaining women around here to find out that the most eligible bachelor in town is poppin' truck stop vitamin V...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HARDPILL_5|||[m:veryangry]So keep your fat mouth shut!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HARDPILL_6|||[m:angry]I'm watching you!

I got another one!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_2|||[m:veryhappy]The Dimensional Divider!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_3|||[m:default]This handy dandy little device actually divides reality into pieces!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_4|||[m:happy]Basically only one enemy will exist at a time!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_5|||[m:pondering]Well that's the goal anyway. Right now all enemies exist but you can only interact with one...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_6|||[m:winking]But with some testing, I'm sure we can crack this baby wide open!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_7|||[m:happy]Now get to it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_1|||[m:happy]Oh man, this is so awesome!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_3|||Why can't you follow simple instructions!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_DIMENSIONALDIVIDER_4|||[m:angry]Too much Deja Vu in the 60s or something!?

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_TRAPFEST99_3|||[m:pondering]I did have some leftovers, you can have 'em...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_TRAPFEST99_4|||[m:questioning]It's just a 4-piece buffalo traps, but it's still something.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_TRAPFEST99_5|||[m:happy]Oh, and here is your payment too![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSDICE_1|||[m:happy]Check out what I found!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSDICE_2|||[m:pondering]It looks like a simple dice, but it has a faint glow to it in the dark.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSDICE_3|||[m:default]I actually found it in your house while you were out on an adventure...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSDICE_4|||[m:paranoid]Look familiar?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSDICE_5|||[m:winking]No? OK good, the deja vu is still in effect.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSDICE_6|||[m:happy]I have no idea what it does, but give it a test run and report back!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_1|||[m:happy]Oh, you're back already!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_2|||[m:pondering]And it appears that dice of yours has settled down a bit.  Interesting...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_3|||[m:default]Eh, honestly you can keep it.  It was basically yours anyway.[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_4|||[m:questioning]Let me know if you ever run into anything else in your house with odd powers...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_5|||[m:pondering]There is something definitely off about that place...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_6|||[m:paranoid]Ever heard of energy vortexes?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_7|||[m:default]Eh, we can talk more about that later.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSDICE_8|||[m:happy]Back to work!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MYSTERIOUSDICE_1|||[m:bored]Lost the dice, huh?  That's gotta suck for you...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MYSTERIOUSDICE_2|||[m:questioning]Well don't beat yourself up over it.  What's lost will eventually be found, right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MYSTERIOUSDICE_3|||[m:default]I gotta get back to work now... so uh, see ya.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MYSTERIOUSDICE_4|||[m:paranoid]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_1|||[m:scared]Here quick, take this piece of paper!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_2|||[m:paranoid]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_3|||[m:veryhappy]HA HA SUCKER! YOU JUST TOOK MY DEBT!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_4|||[m:default]A loan shark has been after me for ages! Every week he breaks another leg!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_5|||[m:happy]Lucky for me, I've got like 2000 Stacys back there with 4 legs each!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_6|||[m:winking]No one outsmarts a scientist!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_7|||[m:happy]But you on the other hand are totally screwed...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_8|||[m:questioning]The only way out of this is to pay off my debt!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_9|||[m:angry]Or you can say goodbye to your legs!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_10|||[m:pondering]Thumbs, fingers, eyes and testicles... in that order, I might add!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_11|||[m:happy]Just pay up and you'll be fine!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_THEIOU_12|||[m:veryhappy]SUCKER!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_1|||[m:shocked]You paid off my debt!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_2|||[m:sad]Wow, what a pal!
Honestly I think I'm tearing up...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_3|||[m:grossedout]No wait, that's just the pepper spray backsplash.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_4|||[m:winking]Stacy and I were just filming one of those "Jerkass" stunts where you blind yourself and asphyxiate.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_5|||[m:veryhappy]Hilarious!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_6|||[m:happy]She's gonna win grand prize for sure!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_7|||[m:grossedout]*cough cough*
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_THEIOU_8|||[m:default]Heh... oh by the way, here is that guy's number if you ever need him for anything.[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_1|||[m:scared]You failed!?
And then you came right back here?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_2|||[m:shocked]What the hell is wrong with you!? He's gonna think I'm you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_3|||[m:paranoid]I can't be stuck with this debt again... You gotta help me man!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_4|||Here, take this gun, enter the time machine and kill me on another timeline.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_5|||But bring the body back here so we can fake my death again...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_6|||[m:angry]No wait, this version of you has no idea what I'm talking about.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_7|||Ugh well whatever, I'll just trick you again later.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_THEIOU_8|||[m:veryangry]GO HOME!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_1|||[m:happy]Check this baby out!
It's a needle full of yellow fluid!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_2|||Mustard water, urine, cat spray and infected sinus mucus with a dash of lemon!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_3|||[m:winking]AKA:The Experimental Treatment!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_4|||[m:veryhappy]Inject that concoction into the cat of your choosing and lord only knows what will happen!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_5|||[m:happy]Head out to {questdestination} and report back with your findings!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_6|||[m:winking]I have a good feeling about this invention!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_1|||[m:shocked]The Experimental Treatment did what!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_2|||[m:winking]Awesome!
Just as I wrote in my notes!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_3|||[m:pondering]Now if we just copy down your findings into my handy dandy palm pilot...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_4|||[m:happy]Done!
I call it the Disorder Decoder!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_5|||[m:default]Wear it around your neck and your disorders can talk to you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_6|||[m:pondering]Just imagine what your autism has to tell you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_7|||[m:spacedout]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_8|||[m:happy]Whatever it is, I'm sure you're going to hear about it...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_9|||[m:winking]A LOT![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:.5][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:.5][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_1|||[m:bored]Failed again huh?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_2|||Well I cant say I'm shocked...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_3|||[m:angry]What a waste of time. Do you realize what your little blunders cost?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_4|||[m:veryangry]Well only the lives of like 13 innocent people!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_5|||[m:angry]Yeah, that's right!
From here on out I'm gonna kill 13 random people each time you fail me!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_6|||[m:veryangry]LET THAT SINK IN! YOUR FAILURE IS DESTROYING LIVES!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_EXPERIMENTALTREATMENT_7|||I HOPE THE GUILT EATS YOU ALIVE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_1|||[m:default]So I had my eyes dilated last week and they sent me home with these cool glasses!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_2|||[m:happy]I'm honestly stumped on what they are for... so I'm putting you on the case!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_3|||[m:questioning]I tried to figure it out myself but I couldn't see a goddamn thing with those on!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_4|||[m:shocked]Imagine trying to skin the roof of somethings mouth when you're basically blind!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_5|||[m:pondering]It's gotta have some use though...
If only we can decipher the tech involved...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_6|||[m:winking]Give them a test run and report back!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_1|||[m:shocked]The glasses just made it harder to see?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_2|||[m:angry]Why would they create something so worthless?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_3|||[m:bored]Whatever.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_4|||[m:questioning]By the way, did you notice that boulder that's been following you around?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_5|||Its got eyes and all that.  I assume you guys are friends?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_6|||[m:paranoid]Well can you make sure to take him home with you?  He's creeping me out.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_7|||[m:winking]Also, here is your payment.[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:.5][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:.5][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_1|||[m:bored]Yeah that quest was pretty dumb...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_2|||[m:questioning]I just really wanted to know what those glasses were used for...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_MYSTERIOUSGLASSES_3|||[m:angry]Guess we will never know.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_1|||[m:question]Were you aware that the government censors the information they make public!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_2|||[m:shocked]IT'S TRUE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_3|||[m:default]Well as a personal protest, I've invented "Redacted".
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_4|||[m:happy]A device that censors...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_5|||[m:veryhappy]Reality!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_6|||[m:questioning]Don't like a specific gender, race or political party?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_7|||[m:veryhappy]Poof! Gone! You'll never be able to see or hear them again!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_8|||[m:sad]Currently it only works on health bars and status icons though...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_9|||[m:winking]But with more testing I'll get it calibrated enough to be used as intended.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_10|||[m:Happy]Help me make this invention a reality!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REDACTED_11|||[m:veryhappy]LET'S GO!!!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_1|||[m:bored]Annnnnnd the invention is still broken...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_2|||[m:pondering]I really thought with enough testing it would work as intended.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_3|||[m:angry]What the heck is wrong with this thing?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_4|||[m:angry]Ugh... whatever.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_5|||[m:bored]Oh, you still expect a reward, huh?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_6|||[m:default]Wait, I have an idea!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_7|||[m:happy]Take this Paper Bag and put it over that ugly mug of yours.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_8|||[m:winking]That way you'll become invisible to me at least!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REDACTED_9|||[m:happy]Quick, put it on![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REDACTED_1|||[m:angry]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REDACTED_2|||I'm pretty pissed about you breaking the Redacted thing I invented!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REDACTED_3|||It had a ton of potential and you just carelessly smashed it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REDACTED_4|||[m:bored]I have nothing else to say... you are a failure.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REDACTED_5|||[m:veryangry]Leave my office immediately!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_1|||[m:veryhappy]New invention alert!
New invention alert!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_2|||[m:happy]This one I call
The Partial Lobotomy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_3|||[m:pondering]You just hammer this sharp pokey thing behind one of your eyeballs...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_4|||[m:happy]AND BAM!!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_5|||[m:veryhappy][s:1.3]BRAIN DAMAGE![/s]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_6|||[m:happy]Like, really bad brain damage too! Pretty cool, right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_7|||[m:winking]So much potential here! Update me on how it goes when you get back!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_1|||[m:happy]Nice work!
I knew creatures could survive with scrambled eggs for brains!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_2|||[m:default]Had that theory since I was a kid! Frontal lobes are so overrated!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_3|||[m:winking]Less thinking, more doing.  That's my motto!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_4|||[m:questioning]Here take the Orbitoclast, I'm not using it anymore.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_5|||[m:default]And here is some cash for your troubles.[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_1|||[m:pondering]Failed huh? did you push the device in deep enough?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_2|||[m:questioning]Did you do the swirly thing with it so the frontal lobe gets all scrambled up?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_3|||[m:bored]Are you sure!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_4|||Ehhh, I still think you did something wrong here...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_5|||[m:pondering]Maybe I scrambled your brains too much...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PARTIALLOBOTOMY_6|||Hmmmm...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_1|||[m:happy]IT'S TIME FOR A NEW INVENTION!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_2|||[m:veryhappy]THE ULTRA VISION 3000!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_3|||[m:happy]This little doohickey is going to be the hot-ticket item of the year!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_4|||[m:whispering]The trick is to only make a few, so they are sold out everywhere to manipulate the masses into thinking people actually like it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_5|||[m:questioning]How does it work you ask? Well, let me tell you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_6|||[m:happy]You put this visor over your eyes and you can see forever!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_7|||So many details! It's a real stop and smell the roses type of effect.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_8|||[m:default]Try 'em out, you'll be discovering things that were right under your nose the whole time!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_9|||[m:paranoid]They do put a really really bad strain on the eyes though... Blink often because these things feel like sandpaper on your cornea!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_ULTRAVISION3000_10|||[m:winking]Sadly, that's my last one! These things are selling like hot cakes!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ULTRAVISION3000_1|||[m:questioning]Oh nice, you're back.  How are your eyes?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ULTRAVISION3000_2|||[m:pondering]Yeah, the dry cracking is a common side effect...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ULTRAVISION3000_3|||[m:happy]Lucky for you I've improved the tech.  I drew a crosshair on the front to avoid causing strabismus.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ULTRAVISION3000_4|||And the whole thing fills with saline fluid so your peepers stay moist.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ULTRAVISION3000_5|||[m:veryhappy]It's all yours!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ULTRAVISION3000_6|||[m:winking]Be sure to tell your friends about the new-and-improved Ultra Vision 3000 v1.1!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_ULTRAVISION3000_7|||[m:happy]That's what I'd be telling you if you had anyone that cared about you anyway...[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ULTRAVISION3000_1|||[m:angry]You really screwed up this time! Don't you know how hard it is to find an Ultra Vision 3000!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ULTRAVISION3000_2|||[m:veryangry]SOLD OUT EVERYWHERE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ULTRAVISION3000_3|||[m:angry]I knew I shouldn't have trusted you with the only existing version!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_ULTRAVISION3000_4|||[m:veryangry]GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_1|||[m:pondering]Were you aware that the key to masculinity is a strong and defined jawline?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_2|||[m:shocked]I read about it online! Literally everyone agrees!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_3|||[m:happy]A man's chin and jawline are vital if you want to have any kind of success these days.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_4|||Necessity is the mother of invention, so it's time to reveal...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_5|||[m:veryhappy]The Chad Implant!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_6|||[m:pondering]Place it onto you existing chin nub and the screws will auto-drill their way deep inside your mandible!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_7|||[m:default]I also added a little strap just in case.  We have had a few instances of the jaw being dislocated from the skull...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_8|||[m:questioning]Looking this good does have its downsides though.  You will become functionally brain dead.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_9|||[m:winking]So just stand there and look pretty, it will be fine.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_CHADIMPLANT_10|||[m:happy]Good luck!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHADIMPLANT_1|||[m:shocked]Oh you are back!
Quick, give me that Chad Implant! Now!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHADIMPLANT_2|||[m:winking]I got someone coming over soon and let's just say the rent is due and it's time to pay up!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHADIMPLANT_3|||[m:pondering]Payment, huh?  Here, take these instructions...[sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHADIMPLANT_4|||[m:default]I printed them out the other day.  They explain how to make yourself better looking naturally.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHADIMPLANT_5|||[m:angry]Now get out of here! If my landlord sees you shakin' that lard bucket of yours around it will really kill the mood!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHADIMPLANT_6|||[m:questioning]He's a pretty old man, so I really need to work my magic on him...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_CHADIMPLANT_7|||[m:angry]Get outta here!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHADIMPLANT_1|||[m:shocked]NO! NOT MY CHAD IMPLANT!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHADIMPLANT_2|||[m:scared]GODDAMNIT! HOW AM I SUPOSED TO PAY RENT WITH A FACE LIKE THIS!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHADIMPLANT_3|||[m:paranoid]Quick, give me your fat!
I'll blend it up and inject it into my jaw!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHADIMPLANT_4|||[m:scared]Hurry hurry! Pull out that ham hock and give me a slice! I hear his car in my driveway!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHADIMPLANT_5|||[m:angry]UGH!
Well there is no point in putting on makeup now! I hope you are happy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHADIMPLANT_6|||[m:veryangry]You ruined my invention, ruined my looks, and ruined my chances in manipulating an elderly man into coitus in exchange for rent!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_CHADIMPLANT_7|||GO AWAY!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STORAGELOCKER_1|||[m:questioning]You know how you can store weapons and ammo in those large metal locker things?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STORAGELOCKER_2|||[m:happy]Well my latest invention takes that idea and improves upon it greatly!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STORAGELOCKER_3|||[m:veryhappy]Feast your eyes on... The Portable Storage Locker!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STORAGELOCKER_4|||[m:winking]It's really just a normal storage locker but with hooks that kinda slip into your shoulder meat.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STORAGELOCKER_5|||[m:happy]Pretty clever, huh?
You can carry tons of neat things!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_STORAGELOCKER_6|||[m:default]Go try it out and give me your feedback after you visit {questdestination}.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STORAGELOCKER_1|||[m:default]I see you are back and the storage locker is still in one piece. Nice!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STORAGELOCKER_2|||[m:questioning]I'll be needing that locker back though. It wasn't the locker I thought it was and that one is filled with tons of my personal effects...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STORAGELOCKER_3|||[m:winking]Here, you can have this though, it's an old armory key.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STORAGELOCKER_4|||[m:happy]Wear it around your neck and the armory fairy will visit you at night!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STORAGELOCKER_5|||[m:veryhappy]And he will bring you knives and ammo!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_STORAGELOCKER_6|||[m:winking]Tell him Thomas said hi when you see him![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_1|||[m:angry]Wheres the locker? Where the hell is my goddamned locker!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_2|||[m:veryangry]I HAD THINGS IN THAT LOCKER! PERSONAL THINGS!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_3|||YOU CAN'T JUST GO LEAVING MY STUFF ON YOUR DEAD CATS AND JUST WANDER BACK HOME WITHOUT IT!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_4|||[m:angry]Now go back and find it!
NOW!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_5|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_6|||[m:angry]What do you mean you can't remember where you left it!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_7|||Well you better go find it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_8|||And it sure as hell isn't in my office!
So turn around and start walking!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_STORAGELOCKER_9|||[m:veryangry]GO!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AI_1|||[m:veryhappy]Invention alert!
Invention alert!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AI_2|||[m:happy]I bring you... AI!,
AKA: Actual Intelligence!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AI_3|||[m:winking]See, what I've done is taken a small portion of my own brain and put it into a computer!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AI_4|||[m:questioning]Then you just take the computer and plug it into your brain and tada!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AI_5|||[m:veryhappy]I'm in complete control!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AI_6|||[m:winking]Just sit back, relax, and watch a real genius at work!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_AI_7|||[m:spacedout]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AI_1|||[m:winking]Told you I was good!
See how I handled that?! That's what YOU should be doing!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AI_2|||[m:happy]Heh, I hope you learned a few tips and tricks from the master!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AI_3|||Now check this new invention out! AI 2.0!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AI_4|||[m:veryhappy]This time I put a piece of my brain inside a robot's brain, and then a piece of that robot's brain inside the brain of another robot!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AI_5|||[m:default]I got all this science stuff locked down tight!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AI_6|||[m:happy]See you later![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_AI_7|||[m:spacedout]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_1|||[m:veryangry]WHAT DID YOU DO!?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_2|||I HAD THINGS HANDLED!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_3|||I DUNNO WHAT YOU DID, BUT YOU REALLY SCREWED IT ALL UP!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_4|||[m:angry]You sure are lucky brains regrow themselves!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_5|||Or me not able to make more brain friend thing!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_6|||[m:questioning]Me go make 'nother gobot, ok?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_7|||[m:spacedout]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_8|||If hims wants to make it go, then that what him wants, ok?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_9|||[m:veryangry]Me mad! ME GO!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_10|||UGGG! RRRAW!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_AI_11|||[m:spacedout]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REALITYSCRAMBLER_1|||[m:pondering]So I was trying to make a device that scrambled eggs...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REALITYSCRAMBLER_2|||[m:shocked]But i ended up creating something that scrambles time and space...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REALITYSCRAMBLER_3|||[m:winking]It still scrambles eggs, but they aren't actually eggs after you scramble them.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REALITYSCRAMBLER_4|||[m:questioning]They look more like a ball of hair and cysts...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REALITYSCRAMBLER_5|||[m:default]Either way, it's still important to add milk so they stay nice and fluffy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_REALITYSCRAMBLER_6|||[m:happy]Now go try out the Reality Scrambler and let me know what you think!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REALITYSCRAMBLER_1|||[m:shocked]Oh, you brought back my Reality Scrambler!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REALITYSCRAMBLER_2|||[m:pondering]I have no memory of even giving it to you to test out... Odd.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REALITYSCRAMBLER_3|||[m:questioning]I assume you expect a reward...
Hmm... how about this?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REALITYSCRAMBLER_4|||[m:default]It's basically the same item but it attaches to your hand!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REALITYSCRAMBLER_5|||[m:pondering]I assume it will give you a bit more control over the chaos?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_REALITYSCRAMBLER_6|||[m:winking]Enjoy![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REALITYSCRAMBLER_1|||[m:shocked]You're back?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REALITYSCRAMBLER_2|||[m:questioning]Wait, were you doing something for me?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REALITYSCRAMBLER_3|||[m:spacedout]Well you're lucky my memory is totally shot because I have no clue what item I even gave you...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_REALITYSCRAMBLER_4|||[m:angry]Either way, I'm mad and busy!
So please leave!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_1|||[m:sad]When I was little, I was very sick...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_2|||My mom would keep me inside so I didn't catch cold, and give me copious amounts of pills to keep me healthy.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_3|||But even with all her care, she still said I was too sick to play outside...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_4|||[m:shocked]Can you believe it!?
This body was once frail!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_5|||[m:happy]But that's when I came up with my first invention...
I called it The Bubble Boy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_6|||[m:default]Try it out!
It's honestly pretty fun to use...
The air quality eventually goes bad, but the bouncing aspect is worth it.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_7|||[m:scared]Also, don't get sick or my mom might come out with her needles and rectal thermometers!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_BUBBLEBOY_8|||[m:winking]Woooooo!
Spoooooky!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_1|||[m:default]Back from the Bubble Boy Bash!?
Pretty cool, right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_2|||[m:pondering]I remember leaping from cliffs in my Bubble Boy as a kid.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_3|||[m:winking]Mom could never find me in the ravine!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_4|||[m:pondering]Gosh, that really takes me back...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_5|||[m:happy]I hope my mom is looking down on me from up there, smiling.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_6|||[m:winking]I keep her body in a trunk in the attic...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_7|||[m:happy]Oh, I almost forgot... Your reward!
It's a thing of Bubbles!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_BUBBLEBOY_8|||Have fun![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_1|||[m:angry]You broke my Bubble Boy!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_2|||[m:veryangry]I'VE HAD THAT THING SINCE I WAS A CHILD! YOU KNOW THAT!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_3|||[m:angry]That's it!
I've had it with your incompetence!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_4|||I give you extremely simple instructions, speak slowly and smile like I'm supposed to...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_5|||Yet you STILL somehow screw it all up!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_6|||[m:veryangry]NEVER COME BACK HERE! I'M BANNING YOU FROM MY OFFICE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_7|||I'LL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_BUBBLEBOY_8|||NOW LEAVE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_1|||[m:default]I noticed Stacy was shivering the other night so I invented this little device...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_2|||[m:happy]The Personal Heater!
I can't believe no one has thought to make something like this before.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_3|||[m:paranoid]I didn't have the parts to add an on/off switch,
so it's just kinda always on.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_4|||[m:winking]But who doesn't want to feel all warm and cozy, right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_5|||[m:veryhappy]Oh, also it has no heat dial, it's just on full blast 24/7
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_6|||[m:winking]So don't touch it with your bare hands because it will burn the hell out of you.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_7|||[m:happy]Anyway, take it for a test spin and let me know how you like it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_PERSONALHEATER_8|||i think this invention could be my big break, baby!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PERSONALHEATER_1|||[m:shocked]Oh man, you look like hell.
Why are you so sweaty and pink?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PERSONALHEATER_2|||[m:winking]Ah yes, my Personal Heater! I see its kept you snug as a bug in a rug!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PERSONALHEATER_3|||[m:happy]Perfect! I'm almost ready to start mass producing them.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PERSONALHEATER_4|||[m:default]I came up with a neat upgrade too! I've added an RC plane propeller to the top of it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PERSONALHEATER_5|||[m:happy]So you can blow that scalding air around a bit!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PERSONALHEATER_6|||[m:default]Thanks for your hard work!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_PERSONALHEATER_7|||[m:winking]I won't forget you when I'm rich and famous![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_1|||[m:veryangry]YOU BASTARD! THAT WAS MY ONLY PROTOTYPE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_2|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_3|||[m:angry]What do you mean it was too hot!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_4|||Well maybe if you lost some weight you wouldn't feel so hot all the time!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_5|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_6|||[m:angry]If the cats were complaining, you should have shaved them!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_7|||My God, take a brain pill or something buddy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_8|||[m:pondering]Brain pills... yes... yes!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_9|||[m:veryhappy]A new invention appears!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PERSONALHEATER_10|||[m:veryangry]NOW LEAVE!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_1|||[m:pondering]Serious question...
Do you believe in life after death?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_2|||[m:angry]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_3|||[m:happy]And at this point, I would have pulled out a gun, smeared on some clown makeup and shot your face off!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_4|||[m:sad]But alas, my younger cooler years are behind me... I've lost my edge...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_5|||[m:pondering]But I have been thinking a lot about where we go when we die...
What could be next for us?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_6|||[m:winking]Well guess what!?
I have a new invention to answer this age-old riddle!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_7|||[m:default]It's called the NDE device!
NDE stands for Near Death Experience by the way...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_NDEDEVICE_8|||[m:happy]Go fiddle with it!
I'm sure something useful will come from it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_1|||[m:happy]See!
I knew nearly dying had its upsides!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_2|||[m:default]With each experiment, I inch my way towards witnessing the face of the Creator first hand!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_3|||[m:veryangry]And when I do...
BOY AM I GOING TO GIVE HIM A PIECE OF MY MIND!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_4|||[m:default]But i digress...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_5|||[m:happy]Here, take this trap!
It pulls souls from dead bodies!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_6|||[m:winking]I'm working on a REAAAAALLLLLY big one out back...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_7|||[m:happy]But we can talk about that later.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_NDEDEVICE_8|||[m:default]See ya![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_1|||[m:angry]What is so hard about this!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_2|||[m:questioning]How hard can it be to suffocate a cat!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_3|||[m:angry]How am i supposed to kill God with your dumb ass just screwing around being extra large!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_4|||[m:veryangry]Seriously, shape up or ship out!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_5|||[m:angry]There are plenty of 600-pound dead ladies in that graveyard out there!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_6|||Don't think you can't be replaced!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_7|||[m:veryangry]START TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY OR YOU'RE GOING BACK, SISTER!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_NDEDEVICE_8|||[m:veryangry]I'M DEAD SERIOUS!

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MULTILINKCABLE_2|||[m:whispering][s:.5]You would...[/s]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MULTILINKCABLE_3|||[m:winking]Well, I got a new invention to solve all your issues!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MULTILINKCABLE_4|||[m:happy]I call it the
Multilink Cable!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MULTILINKCABLE_5|||[m:default]It hooks into all my other inventions and syncs them!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MULTILINKCABLE_6|||That way, all of them lock in the same destination!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MULTILINKCABLE_7|||[m:pondering]Looks like this one is set to be taken to {questdestination}
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_MULTILINKCABLE_8|||[m:happy]Go give it a try!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_1|||[m:shocked]WHAT!?
You seriously completed 4 of my quests at once?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_2|||HOW?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_3|||[m:pondering]Something smells fishy here...
How could an idiot like you achieve something so grand!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_4|||[m:happy]Oh yeah,
[s:1.2]ME![/s]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_5|||[m:default]If it wasn't for MY Multilink cable you'd probably be scratching at the walls of an empty swimming pool somewhere...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_6|||[m:questioning]Anyway here, since you seem to love cables so much.  I was just about to throw this one out.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_7|||[m:happy]It's a USBF cable.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_MULTILINKCABLE_8|||[m:winking]I'd tell you what the F stands for, but the feds got this place wired...

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_1|||[m:questioning]Have you heard of the term hive mind?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_2|||[m:pondering]Me either, but it sounds cool right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_3|||[m:happy]So cool that I'm basing a whole invention on it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_4|||[m:veryhappy]The Hive Mind!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_5|||[m:questioning]It's this fleshy prolapsed blob thing you wear on your head that looks like a bee hive!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_6|||[m:happy]Not only is it fashionable,
but it's also functional!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_7|||[m:veryhappy]It makes everyone mirror the person wearing it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_8|||[m:pondering]No idea why either!
It just works...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_INTRO_HIVEMIND_9|||[m:default]Go find a use for it and report back!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_HIVEMIND_1|||[m:happy]I see you tried out the Hive Mind...
Pretty fresh, right?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_HIVEMIND_2|||[m:pondering]I'm thinking it could catch on overseas.  They love dumb, ugly stuff like this!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_HIVEMIND_3|||[m:happy]Hey that reminds me, I just finished another fashion!
I call it... "Remote Head"!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_COMPLETE_HIVEMIND_4|||[m:winking]Take it as your reward![sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin][pause:1][sfx:PickupCoin]

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HIVEMIND_1|||[m:veryangry]Well you owe me 600 bucks you thief!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HIVEMIND_2|||[m:angry]That Hive Mind thing could have made me millions on the runway!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HIVEMIND_3|||[m:veryangry]Even Stacy said it was chic!
And she's a real fashionista!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_HIVEMIND_4|||[m:angry]LEAVE!

What now?
I think I've yelled at you more than enough already...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_PRINCESSHAT_4|||[m:questioning]OK, here's the deal.  As you walk out, I'm going to throw a brick at you...

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GENERIC_1|||[m:shocked]You lost the {questitemname}?

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIESQUEST_FAIL_GENERIC_3|||[m:angry]It's gonna take me ages to make another one of those. Thanks for nothing.

NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_LAB_INTRO_18|||[m:pondering][s:.7]Who am I kidding?
You wouldn't know your ass
from a headless howler monkey.[/s]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_LAB_INTRO_19|||[m:questioning]There is a big metal chamber at the very back of my lab.  Go there and press the shiny red button.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_LAB_INTRO_20|||[m:angry]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_LAB_INTRO_21|||[m:bored]Find metal box.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_LAB_INTRO_22|||Press red button.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_LAB_INTRO_23|||[m:angry]Got it?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_LAB_INTRO_24|||[m:veryangry]Now GO!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_1|||[m:shocked]It's not working?! [m:questioning]Someone must have eaten the power source... hmmm
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_2|||[m:pondering]So to get the time machine back up and running we are going to need a new power source.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_3|||[m:default]Yeah, it's a time machine. We have been using it this whole time, [m:winking]you just don't remember it in this timeline.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_4|||[m:paranoid]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_5|||[m:default]Well it's busted now. [m:angry]Your fault, so it's your job to fix it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_6|||[m:pondering]We just need a new piezoelectric generator or something like one...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_7|||[m:veryhappy]I'VE GOT IT!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_8|||[m:shocked]Legend has it, an immortal is dwelling directly under our feet! In this place called the "Throbbing Domain", he's been locked down there for centuries!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_9|||[m:winking]That thing's heart would make a perfect source of power!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_10|||[m:happy]Here, take this cooler. It has regenerative properties and should keep the heart from decaying once it's removed.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_11|||[m:scared]Uuuhh, it also may revive anything else that dies around it, [m:winking]so maybe make sure to eviscerate your enemies?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_INTRO_12|||[m:angry]Now go get that heart so I can undo your mistakes!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_1|||[m:scared]Just so you know, that smell isn't me...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_2|||[m:default]It's my excrement receptacle.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_3|||[m:questioning]As a fellow hobo I'm sure you know, us bums defecate in bags...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_4|||[m:bored]This is my life now.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_5|||[m:spacedout]Bag defecation, thieving and copious amounts of pills... [m:bored]Such is the life of a vagrant.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_6|||[m:default]But i digress.
I see you have a cooler with the still beating heart of our lord and savior, super meat ball.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_7|||[m:happy]Good work!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_8|||Now just go back to my time machine, install the heart and hop inside.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_9|||[m:pondering]I'm unsure of its current settings...
but it should send you somewhere into the past.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_10|||[m:happy]Maybe even before you existed! Crazy, huh?
You could meet your great great uncle grandpa!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_11|||[m:scared]Oh, uh..
but there's a thing I gotta tell you about...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_12|||[m:default]You've probably never heard of it, but there is this theory I came up with called the butterfly effect.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_13|||[m:pondering]It's something like, if you kill a butterfly in the past, your mom dies?
I can't remember the details right now...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_14|||[m:default]The point I'm trying to make is, if you change something in the past, it's bound to affect the future in some way...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_15|||[m:happy]So just smash the hell out of as many things in the past as possible!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_16|||[m:pondering]I assume at some point, the chaos you cause will end up changing our current timeline...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_17|||[m:angry]Hopefully enough that I'm back in my lab, defecating into something that flushes...
[s:.7]Or at least swallows.[/s]
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_18|||[m:bored]I'll ping you when I notice a change...
'Till then, I'll just be sitting here.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_19|||[m:happy]I've taken up drinking and it's pretty nice.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TIMEMACHINE_2_20|||[m:spacedout]Kinda feels like a time machine in itself honestly...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_JURASSIC_INTRO_1|||[m:pondering]Well it's pretty obvious that killing cavemen isn't helping us at all...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_JURASSIC_INTRO_2|||[m:happy]We need to go further!
Back to a time before man!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_JURASSIC_INTRO_3|||[m:questioning]Just set the little dial thingy to 0 and see where you end up.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_JURASSIC_INTRO_4|||[m:winking]When you make it to your destination, just hop out and start smashin' stuff!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_JURASSIC_INTRO_5|||[m:veryhappy]For the future of humanity!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_1|||[m:angry]Yeah well I guess your dumb time machine idea didn't work...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_2|||[m:default]It's pretty clear our answers don't lie in the past, but in the future! Obviously!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_3|||[m:questioning]Why you thought going into the past would change a damn thing is beyond me...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_4|||[m:default]Listen, just set the machine to
THE FUTURE
and hop inside.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_5|||[m:default]Then find a phone book and look me up.  I'll no doubt be extremely wealthy and have invented some way to fix our current issues.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_6|||[m:pondering]In fact, when you find future me, just bring me back to our timeline. Then the two of us can put our brains together and [m:veryhappy]really fuck shit up!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_7|||[m:shocked]Fix shit up...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_8|||[m:angry]Fix up the shit that you did!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_9|||[m:happy]God, these pills got my lips slapping today don't they?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_10|||[m:questioning]What was I saying?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_FUTURE_INTRO_11|||[m:default]Oh yeah, go get me more drugs!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_1|||[m:shocked]What do you mean you couldn't find future me!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_2|||[m:questioning]Nazis?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_3|||[m:angry]What the hell are you talking about?
You sound paranoid.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_4|||[m:scared]Unless...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_5|||[m:veryangry]THEY STOLE MY IDEAS!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_6|||Those bastards!
[m:angry]You gotta stoop pretty low to steal the ideas of a freakin' street urchin...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_7|||[m:veryangry]The gall!
If you see the guy in charge you tell him, you point right at his thief face and you say "THIEF!"
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_8|||[m:angry]No, you call him a [m:veryangry]Rat Fink! [m:angry]and furrow your brow when you do it so he knows you mean it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_9|||[m:angry]No one steals my ideas and gets away with it! Next time you kill him, say something like...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_10|||[m:winking]Dr. Beanies sends his regards!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_11|||[m:angry]And in case hes confused on who I am, you give him my address!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_12|||1984 Demikhov Dr. Boon County U.S Fuckin' A!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_13|||[m:default]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_14|||[m:sad]By the way, do you have any change on you?
I need it for gas money.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEEFUTURE_15|||[m:happy]I'm huffing gasoline now.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_THEEND_INTRO_1|||[m:angry]OK, so forget about the future, the future sucks!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_THEEND_INTRO_2|||[m:veryhappy]This time we need to go further, we gotta see how it all ends!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_THEEND_INTRO_3|||[m:pondering]I assume just holding down 0 for a few minutes should get us there...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_THEEND_INTRO_4|||[m:happy]Yeah, that's gotta work.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_THEEND_INTRO_5|||[m:veryhappy]TO THE END!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_1|||[m:shocked]What? Why are you looking at me like that?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_2|||[m:veryangry]If you think I had anything to do with the world ending buddy...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_3|||[m:angry]Like seriously think about it.  If anything, you probably did it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_4|||Don't you realize the risks you are taking manipulating time?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_5|||[m:paranoid]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_6|||[m:default]Who are they going to believe anyway? An old disheveled hobo?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_7|||[m:happy]Or a reanimated dead woman with an army of cats who can time travel?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_8|||[m:winking]My hands are clean, buddy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_9|||[m:pondering]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_10|||[m:default]Figuratively of course, obviously my hands are filthy right now.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_11|||[m:veryangry]BECAUSE OF YOU!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SEETHEEND_12|||[m:angry]Fix this!!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_1|||[m:default]So check this out.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_2|||[m:questioning]You know that death bot Hitler sent from the future to kill you?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_3|||[m:veryhappy]It was riddled with science!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_4|||[m:default]I was able to hack together what us men of science call, an antenna.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_5|||Now I won't bore you with technical mumbo-jumbo.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_6|||[m:happy]But this thing might be our ticket out of this pee-pee soaked heck hole!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_7|||[m:default]Just take this thing to that active volcano in the Jurassic period.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_8|||[m:winking]Leave it there and I'll do the rest.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_9|||[m:veryhappy]Oh man, I've got such a huge theory right now, I feel light headed!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR1_DEFEAT_10|||[m:happy]GO!
Get on it!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR2_DEFEAT_1|||[m:questioning]Remember that liquid metal Nazi from the future you just killed?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR2_DEFEAT_2|||[m:happy]Well I made another antenna out of its juices!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR2_DEFEAT_3|||[m:default]Don't ask how.  God knows you'd probably die of an aneurysm even attempting to comprehend it...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR2_DEFEAT_4|||[m:happy]So just go take this new antenna and attach it to the glowing orb at the end of time.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR2_DEFEAT_5|||[m:pondering]We just need a good amplifier to really get the ball rolling on this plan of mine.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR2_DEFEAT_6|||[m:happy]You think they hand out the Nobel Prize in the afterlife?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_TERMINATOR2_DEFEAT_7|||[m:winking]I guess we will just have to find out, won't we!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_1|||[m:default]So i have good news and bad news...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_2|||[m:scared]The bad news is Hitler is back with a small army of robotic cats to destroy you.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_3|||[m:veryhappy]The good news is, I've invented a bucket with a hole at the bottom!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_4|||[m:pondering]It's kind of like a toilet meets a chair...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_5|||[m:default]When you want to make brown you just sit on the top of the bucket and push.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_6|||[m:happy]Once you are done you just stand up, remove the bucket and leave the refuse on the floor where it landed.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_7|||[m:winking]Pretty neat, huh?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_8|||[m:pondering]I'm working on installing this, well I guess it's like a putty trowel...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_9|||[m:happy]I like to call it
"Trowlet Paper"... It's installed at the lip of the bucket and you just kinda...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_10|||[m:whispering]Lean and scrape... It's this kind of butt-dragging motion...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_11|||[m:happy]It's a work in progress but yeah, you could say things are really coming up Beanies these days!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_12|||[m:winking]Now if you don't mind, it's time to give it another test run!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_1|||[m:happy]We did it!
Hitler is dead once again!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_2|||[m:veryhappy]U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_3|||[m:whispering]But i digress...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_4|||[m:default]I don't mean to outdo you once again, but it's time...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_5|||[m:happy]Time to bask in the glory of the great Amplifier!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_6|||This little baby not only boosts signals, but when attached to a large enough power source it can do so through time!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_7|||[m:questioning]Remember those antennas I had you place in the past and future? [m:mocking]Well spoiler! There was a reason.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_8|||[m:default]If I can boost the signal on those things high enough, they should connect...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_9|||[m:veryhappy]Revealing...
THE INFINITE!!!!!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_10|||[m:happy]What is the Infinite you ask? Well that is for me to know, and for you to find out!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_11|||[m:default]So go attach this amplifier to that demi-god in the Rift.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_12|||That freak should have more than enough juice to get us where we need to be...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_HITLER3_DEFEAT_13|||[m:happy]God, I'm good...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_1|||[m:sad]So the moment you got back into the time machine the Creator started regenerating...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_2|||[m:pondering]Probably should have expected as much...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_3|||[m:questioning]Well, there has got to be some way of ending this arrogant prick's tyranny...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_4|||[m:shocked]Wait...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_5|||[m:pondering]Wait just a goddamn minute...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_6|||[m:happy]Yes... yes, I HAVE IT!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_7|||[m:veryhappy]NUKE THE FETAL CHRIST CHILD!!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_8|||[m:veryangry]We build a nuke so powerful that not even an atom will remain!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_9|||[m:default]Here, I just happen to have kept a jar of radioactive liquid...
Just in case.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_10|||[m:pondering]Take it.
I'll need you to mix the fluid with the life essence of another eternal...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_11|||[m:default]That king you stole the heart from could work.  Just mix in his blood and bring it here.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_12|||[m:happy]Don't worry, we will beat this "Supreme Being" or die trying!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_BEGIN_13|||[m:veryhappy]GODSPEED!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_2_1|||[m:veryhappy]Great!
Radioactive demi-blood!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_2_2|||[m:pondering]But it needs something else... A little bit of chaos to shake things up!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_2_3|||[m:default]Take it with you into the Rift and slice off a piece of that giant head.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_2_4|||[m:questioning]The vibrations from an extra dimensional being like that should keep our concoction in a perpetual state of flux.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_2_5|||[m:happy]Get that mixture to me ASAP and I'll build a bomb so big, Oppenheimer will start spinning in his grave!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_2_6|||[m:veryhappy]Now go!
Into the Rift with ya!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_1|||[m:happy]Oh yes, perfect...
This little brew is exactly what the doctor ordered!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_2|||[m:default]I just pop it inside this nuclear bomb and viola!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_3|||[m:veryhappy]THE GOD KILLER!!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_4|||[m:pondering]Or maybe the
"Time Ender"?
I dunno, what sounds cooler?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_5|||[m:questioning]It needs to convey that it kills God, but should also insinuate it taking everything else with it...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_6|||[m:bored]Bombageddon?
the Backdoor Boom Boom?...
eh..
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_7|||[m:default]Whatever.  I'll come up with the name later...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_8|||[m:happy]I'm adding a little hologram projector to the bomb, so once you are ready to detonate...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_9|||[m:winking]I'll chime in and do this little action hero one liner I've prepared.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_3_10|||[m:happy]See you soon!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFRADIATION_1|||[m:angry]Well you failed me again...
Don't worry at this point, I'm getting used to it.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFRADIATION_2|||[m:happy]No one said killing God was going to be easy!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFRADIATION_3|||[m:default]Now here's that jar of radioactive fluid again!
Don't worry, I have like over 100 drums of it scattered around town.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFRADIATION_4|||[m:winking]Plenty more where that came from!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFRADIATION_5|||[m:questioning]Take it to the king in the Throbbing Domain and mix in some of his blood.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFRADIATION_6|||[m:default]Bring it back and I'll get you moving to your final destination.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFRADIATION_7|||[m:veryhappy]GO GO GO!
Humanity depends on you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_1|||[m:veryangry]YOU LOST THE JAR OF RADIOACTIVE BLOOD!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_2|||[m:angry]HOW!? HOW CAN YOU LOSE A JAR!?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_3|||[m:shocked]Oh God...
You didn't...
Where did you put it?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_4|||[m:paranoid]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_5|||[m:happy]Ohhhhhhh...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_6|||[m:default]You lost it when your cats died!
Well that's better I guess...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_7|||[m:paranoid]I thought for a second there you were one of those "Perverts"[m:grossedout].
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_8|||[m:default]Lucky for you, I have yet another jar of radioactive fluid!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_9|||[m:bored]...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_10|||[m:pondering]Wait a minute...
You aren't just scamming me for jars are you?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_11|||[m:angry]If I even see one video pop up online involving ANY of my jars...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_12|||[m:veryangry]There will be hell to pay!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFBLOOD_13|||[m:winking]Good luck!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_1|||[m:shocked]Hey...
Wheres the jar of chaos?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_2|||[m:paranoid]You didn't drink it did you?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_3|||[m:angry]Cuz' you gotta share if you are gonna be doing that!
I mean, it's my jar so I get dibs.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_4|||[m:winking]Daddy gets a sip-sip, OK?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_5|||[m:default]Anyway here,
take another jar and go get us more juice!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_6|||[m:shocked]Or wait.. no.
No we are supposed to be killing God!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_7|||[m:confused]You got my brain all focused on that damn purple drank!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_8|||[m:angry]Put down the jar and keep your eye on the prize!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_9|||[m:default]Take this jar of radioactive fluid and let's end all this!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_JAROFCHAOS_10|||[m:happy] Together!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_1|||[m:scared]Uh oh...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_2|||[m:questioning]I can't imagine God is going to take kindly to an attempted assassination...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_3|||[m:bored]Pppfft, who am I kidding?  That guys' an idiot!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_4|||[m:angry]Think about it.  Any "Creator" who puts a pleasure button inside a mans poop-shoot can't be that smart can he?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_5|||I mean who does that?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_6|||[m:pondering]So tempting, yet just out of reach...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_7|||...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_8|||[m:default]What I'm trying to say is that God is just as much of a halfwit as you are!
So we are probably safe to try this again.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_9|||Here...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_10|||[m:happy]Take this jar of radioactive fluid and do all that stuff again.
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_11|||[m:angry]BUT THIS TIME DON'T SCREW UP!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_FAIL_NUKE_12|||[m:winking]Good luck!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_AMNESIA_1|||[m:shocked]What do you mean you thought I died?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_AMNESIA_2|||[m:veryhappy]Jesus, you must be as drunk as I am!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_AMNESIA_3|||[m:shocked]What!?
Steven?!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_AMNESIA_4|||[m:pondering]Nope, Doesn't ring a bell...
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_AMNESIA_5|||[m:happy]Now can you please leave me alone?
I'm working on an invention that will change the world!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_BOMBQUEST_AMNESIA_6|||[m:winking]I don't wanna spoil it...
But involves a glass jar!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_ILOVEYOU_1|||[m:inlove]I love you... I love you!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_ILOVEYOU_2|||[m:happy]I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_ILOVEYOU_3|||[m:veryhappy]I LOVE YOU VERY VERY VERY MUCH!
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SCREENSHAKE_TEST_1|||[m:default]Hey, guess what?
NPC_BEANIES_BEANIES_SCREENSHAKE_TEST_2|||[m:shocked]!!!

//butch_progression|||
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_1|||Why are you here?
NPC_BUTCH_UNKNOWN_1|||You appear to have unlocked something, but I don't have dialog for it. Congrats. Also fix this.
NPC_BUTCH_ALSO_1|||Also...
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_1|||[m:default]So it looks like that sewer monster man built you a pipe, huh?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_2|||[m:angry]Well don't feel special, I got one too!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_3|||[m:pondering]Hey, that gives me an idea...
[m:questioning]How about you and I go into business together?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_4|||You send me cats with combat experience, [m:inlove]and I let you kiss me behind the dumpster over there?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_5|||[m:angry]What do you mean "no"?!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_6|||[m:happy]Yeah well, what about I expand that little box of yours then, huh?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_7|||[m:angry]I'm talking about that box by your house, sicko!!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_8|||[m:default]I can upgrade that ol' shoe box for ya, that way you can hold more sharp objects!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_9|||[m:happy]Trust me it's worth it.  Just send me a cat who's killed some stuff!
I'll hook you up.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_1_1|||[m:happy]Hey, that cat you sent me could really take a punch, thanks!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_1_2|||[m:default]So as per our agreement, I'll upgrade that storage box of yours.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_1_3|||[m:pondering]Still pretty tiny honestly.  I got bigger ones... But they will cost ya!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_1_4|||[m:default]Send more cats with fighting experience and I'll expand it more!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_1_5|||[m:default]This time though, I want cats that have ventured further from home.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_1_6|||[m:pondering]You're gonna need to venture into the sewers or junkyard this time.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_1_7|||[m:happy]Good luck!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_2_1|||[m:happy]So those cats you sent are working out great!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_2_2|||[m:whispering]I've been training them to steal medication from the old and bewildered.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_2_3|||[m:default]As promised, I've upgraded your item storage again!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_2_4|||[m:default]I need stronger cats next time though!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_2_5|||[m:pondering]Ones with serious experience.
I'm talking cats that have been to the caves or that old cemetery.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_2_6|||[m:default]Thanks, buddy.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_1|||[m:default]My cat army continues to grow!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_2|||[m:default]With your help I've been able to move up from petty theft to straight up kidnapping!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_3|||[m:happy]Yep, I've trained those cats you gave me to steal the elderly!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_4|||[m:whispering]I got like 6 old people inside that dumpster back there...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_5|||[m:pondering]Not sure what I'll do with them yet, but I'm thinking about setting up kissing booths or something...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_6|||[m:default]I dunno, either way, they are there if I need 'em.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_7|||[m:pondering]If I wanna up my game I'm going to need better cats...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_8|||[m:default]I'm only gonna accept cats who have been inside that bunker to the west, or the crater left by that meteor.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_3_9|||[m:angry]Get on it!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_1|||[m:happy]OK get this, I've trained the cats to ride those old people I stole!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_2|||[m:shocked]Imagine waking up to that!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_3|||[m:veryhappy]Cats riding grandma as she's donkey kickin' around the living room!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_4|||[m:questioning]Sadly, the cash flow is a bit low still.  I gotta focus and really figure out how to turn a profit...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_5|||[m:confused]?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_6|||[m:shocked]Did you just ask why am I doing this?!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_7|||[m:angry]Pretty judgemental coming from someone like you!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_8|||[m:questioning]Eh... I dunno.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_9|||Ever feel like there is just a hole in your heart?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_10|||[m:pondering]Not like a gunshot or murmur, but like something is missing?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_11|||[m:sad]Ever since I could remember, I've just always felt like I was half the man I should be...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_12|||[m:scared]Uh...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_13|||[m:angry]Now you got me acting like a freakin' girl!
Get the hell out of here!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_14|||[m:veryangry]I was just joking about all that stuff I said!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_15|||[m:default]You have more room in your storage now by the way...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_16|||[m:default]I want better cats also! Center of the Earth, or Space.  I need cats that have been there!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_4_17|||[m:angry]Now leave!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_1|||[m:pondering]...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_2|||[m:default]Oh, sorry... I was just touching my scar.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_3|||[m:questioning]No, not the cat scratches, the scar on the side of my face... You never noticed it?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_4|||[m:happy]Always thought it made me look tough... I've had it as long as I can remember.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_5|||[m:default]Anyway, that's not important.  What is important is how well my business is doing!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_6|||[m:happy]You guessed it!
I've started murdering!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_7|||[m:pondering]Well, not me personally,
but the cats you sent me!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_8|||[m:veryhappy]They are straight up killing people all over town!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_9|||[m:pondering]Sadly it's just drifters and hobos currently, so not much news coverage...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_10|||[m:default]But with your help, I'm sure I'll move up to
"real people"
and start turning a profit.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_11|||Sent you a huge storage shed as payment by the way!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_12|||[m:happy]Some dude was just living in it...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_13|||[m:pondering]Or dying in it...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_14|||[m:default]Either way, it's yours now!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_15|||[m:default]If you want more boxes, I need cats who have traveled through time!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_5_16|||Not sure why... but that's my new rule!
I only accept cats who are time travelers!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_1|||[m:sad]Jesus Christ I'm lonely...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_2|||I was talking to my army of the night the other day and the topic of fathers came up...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_3|||I just started bawling like a baby!
What the hell is wrong with me!?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_4|||...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_5|||[m:shocked]There was a mutiny and everything!
I had to murder them to re-establish myself as the alpha!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_6|||[m:sad]So yeah... I guess starting from scratch again.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_7|||...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_8|||[m:questioning]Do you remember your father?  Because I'm not sure if I even had one...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_9|||[m:pondering]Pretty sure I remember having a bedroom.  Lots of wires and monitors maybe?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_10|||Someone was always there with me? Maybe a brother? Not sure...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_11|||[m:angry]Ugh so frustrating...
Who am I?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_12|||[m:sad]...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_13|||Oh also your shed is bigger...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_14|||From here on out I need cats who have seen dinosaurs or the fate of the Earth.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_6_15|||[m:sad]...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_1|||[m:sad]Yeah, sorry... I didn't do much with those cats.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_2|||I've just been so sad...
[m:angry]and it's really starting to piss me off!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_3|||Why do I feel like I'm missing a piece of myself!?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_4|||[m:sad]It's like when people lose an arm and have phantom limb pain, but I feel this "phantom existence".
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_5|||[m:spacedout]Like I'm living in two timelines...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_6|||[m:veryangry]GAH!
I hate this!
I need to do something to keep my mind occupied!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_7|||[m:angry]I think I'll go murder that doctor guy... There is something about that dude.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_8|||[m:veryangry]Something that really pisses me off!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_9|||[m:sad]I'm out of big storage upgrades!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_10|||But if you keep sending me cats I'm sure I can figure something out.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_11|||[m:winking]I found a bunch of mason jars behind Pinky Winkies...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_12|||[m:default]Oh, but from here on out I'm only taking cats who have seen God! period!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_7_13|||[m:angry]Now leave me alone!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_REPEATING_INTRO_1|||[m:default]Thanks for those cats
I guess...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_REPEATING_INTRO_2|||[m:questioning]Umm, so I found this old jar.  I think can you fit something inside it?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_REPEATING_INTRO_3|||[m:veryangry]Listen! Beggars can't be choosers! You get what you get!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_REPEATING_INTRO_4|||[m:angry]A single storage unit is nothing to scoff at!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_REPEATING_INTRO_5|||[m:sad]Me and this jar have been through a lot together...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_REPEATING_INTRO_6|||No, no.. that was the past... Take it, it's yours.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_REPEATING_INTRO_7|||[m:default]Keep sending me cats who have killed God and I'll find more storage stuff...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX1_1|||[m:pondering]So uh...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX1_2|||[m:happy]Here, have this shoe box!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX1_3|||[m:default]I found it in the Doctor's lab. It was filled with baby pictures...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX1_4|||[m:questioning]What a weirdo huh? Anyway, that should be able to store a single item for ya!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX1_5|||[m:default]Remember, I'm only taking cats that cleared the Infinite.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX1_6|||Good luck!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX2_1|||[m:default]I stole this moving box from some hobo...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX2_2|||[m:confused]It's a bit wet, but I'm sure it can still hold something.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX2_3|||[m:questioning]A unit of storage is a unit of storage!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX2_4|||[m:default]Send more cats...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX3_1|||[m:default]Trash bag!
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX3_2|||[m:happy]Take this trash bag,
I just found it.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX3_3|||[m:questioning]I'm sure it's big enough to hold whatever...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX3_4|||[m:default]Meh...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX3_5|||[m:default]You know the drill.
Send more cats.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX4_1|||[m:shocked]Oh, uh...
I didn't expect you to be back so soon...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX4_2|||[m:pondering]Uuuhhhh...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX4_3|||[m:happy]Oh, take this trash bin! That's good enough...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX4_4|||[m:default]I was using it to store the cats you sent me but I got some rope...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX4_5|||[m:default]Send more cats from that heaven place or whatever.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX5_1|||[m:default]Man, you are really committed to this storage expansion stuff aren't you?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX5_2|||[m:questioning]I don't wanna sound judgy but like... Have you ever thought you might be mentally ill?
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX5_3|||[m:spacedout]...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX5_4|||[m:winking]Same dude, same.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX5_5|||[m:default]Anyway, take this bucket.  I stole it from that doctor guy.  Not sure why there is a hole in it...
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX5_6|||[m:pondering]I'm sure it can still store something.
NPC_BUTCH_UPGRADE_STORAGE_MAX5_7|||[m:default]You know the drill...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MEDIC_1|||[m:default]So check this out,
I got a new collar for ya.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MEDIC_2|||[m:default]This class is called
the [b]Cleric[/b],
[s:.7][m:whispering]a pretty hoity toity religious type.[/s]
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MEDIC_3|||[m:happy]Judgmental sure, but boy can they heal things!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MEDIC_4|||[m:default]With a solid Cleric on your team, ain't no one going down.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MEDIC_5|||And if someone does,
[m:happy]just pray on it!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_THIEF_1|||[m:happy]Well well well.
It looks like you got another collar!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_THIEF_2|||The Thief!
a personal favorite of mine.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_THIEF_3|||[m:questioning]Someone bothering you?

[m:veryangry]Thief can stab them in the back!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_THIEF_4|||[m:questioning]Need some extra cash?

[m:happy]Well you know the Thief's got sticky fingers!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_THIEF_5|||[m:mocking]And don't get me started on how quick they are!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_THIEF_6|||[m:whispering]Just hope the girls don't find out!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_THIEF_7|||[m:happy]Haw haw haw
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_NECROMANCER_1|||[m:shocked]Uh oh,
did someone make a deal with the devil?!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_NECROMANCER_2|||[m:veryhappy]Necromancer
in the house!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_NECROMANCER_3|||[m:happy]It's the BTGGF
of your dreams!
the leech queen who never stops sucking...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_NECROMANCER_4|||[m:scared][a:shake][s:1.3]YOUR BLOOD![/s][/a]
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_NECROMANCER_5|||[m:default]Yeah the Necro's pretty cool, it's just that smell that gets to me...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_NECROMANCER_6|||[m:sad]I just cant get down with that rotting flesh stench.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_PSYCHIC_1|||[m:happy]And there's more!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_PSYCHIC_2|||[m:default]The Psychic is here for all your mind-bending needs!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_PSYCHIC_3|||They read minds as well as my kids [m:angry]can read the back of my hand!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_PSYCHIC_4|||[m:happy]I'm kidding!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_PSYCHIC_5|||They aren't my kids!
Hell, I don't even know 'em!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_PSYCHIC_6|||[m:winking]But seriously, the Psychic is cool.
Go check 'em out!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_TINKERER_1|||[m:questioning]I bet at this point you are asking yourself, how many classes are there?
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_TINKERER_2|||[m:happy]Well lucky for you,
the Tinkerer is great at math!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_TINKERER_3|||[m:default]And at building robots n' junk.  Honestly they are crafty AF!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_TINKERER_4|||I watched a Tinkerer sit down and build himself a robo-wife...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_TINKERER_5|||[m:shocked]That cleaned his whole house!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_TINKERER_6|||[m:default]Then it just bitched him out about nothing for 12 hours, and crashed his new car.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_TINKERER_7|||[m:happy]Heh...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_DRUID_1|||[m:confused]Jesus Christ the number of classes, seriously...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_DRUID_2|||[m:questioning]So this one's a Druid or something?
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_DRUID_3|||[m:spacedout]Its got a crow and is always humming to itself...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_DRUID_4|||[m:pondering]I dunno,
I wasn't paying attention.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_BUTCHER_1|||[m:happy]OK, here we go!
This one's pretty damn cool!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_BUTCHER_2|||[m:veryhappy]The Butcher!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_BUTCHER_3|||[m:inlove]Its got a freakin' meat hook attached to a chain, attached to its arm!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_BUTCHER_4|||[m:veryhappy]How badass is that?!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_BUTCHER_5|||[m:questioning]He's also a lard-ass who can't stop eating.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_BUTCHER_6|||[m:mocking]I bet you can relate huh!?
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_BUTCHER_7|||[m:veryhappy]Ha!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_1|||[m:default]And yet another class appears!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_2|||This one's a Monk.
Hates armor, loves punching.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_3|||[m:pondering]Slaps, punches, pokes, palms, wet willies, jabs, thrusts, haymakers and uppercuts.
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_4|||[m:default]The list goes on...
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_5|||So if you're into getting beat up or watching people get beat up
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_6|||[m:happy]The Monk is right up your alley!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_7|||[m:whispering][s:.6]...yeah, right next to their fist probably.[/s]
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_MONK_8|||[m:happy]Ha!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_JESTER_1|||[m:questioning][s:1.2]WHAT?[/s]
There's another one!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_JESTER_2|||[m:shocked]The Jester!?
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_JESTER_3|||[m:spacedout]How fucking random!
NPC_BUTCH_CLASS_UNLOCK_JESTER_4|||[m:happy]Enjoy!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_A_1|||Yeah, so are you tired of losing? Well if you want some tips from a winner, just ask!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_B_1|||[m:questioning]Looking for tips from a pro? Well you came to the right place!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_C_1|||[m:happy]Well look who's come crawling back for help! Don't worry, I gotcha!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_D_1|||[m:mocking]Well if it isn't the loser! [m:default]Don't worry, with my help you can become less losery! [m:angry]Listen up!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_E_1|||[m:veryhappy]Hahahahaha haha!
Yeah that's right, I'm laughing at you! Are you going to listen to my tips this time?!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_F_1|||You know I hand out free tips to losers, right?
You seem in need of some...
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_G_1|||[m:shocked]Oh, you scared me! I thought I was about to be mugged by a loser incapable of logical thought!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_G_2|||[m:happens]Just joshing ya kid, I'm here to help!
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_H_1|||What is it this time? [m:happy]Come back to a pro for some pro tips?
NPC_BUTCH_UNPROMPTED_I_1|||I guess you are looking for a hand out?
Well all I got is tips kid!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTRO_1|||[m:default]Yeah, I noticed you keep losing. Losing makes you look like a loser, so listen.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTRO_2|||[m:angry]I trained you, and you're kinda making me look bad.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTRO_3|||[m:default]If you want to be a winner you gotta [m:veryangry]LISTEN TO ME!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTRO_4|||[m:questioning]So, are you ready for a few tips?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTELLIGENCE_1|||[m:default]You probably know your [img:int] is a pretty important stat.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTELLIGENCE_2|||But did you realize if your [img:int] number is the same or more than your favorite spell,
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTELLIGENCE_3|||[m:happy]That means you can cast it every single turn!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INTELLIGENCE_4|||[m:default]Always check your [img:int] and the mana costs of your abilities when you level up and make sure you can cast them!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_CHARISMA_1|||[m:default][img:cha] doesn't only affect your max mana.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_CHARISMA_2|||Your [img:cha] number is literally how much mana your cat starts battle with.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_CHARISMA_3|||[m:happy]Keep that in mind when choosing new abilities.  Being able to cast 1-2 spells on turn 1 is badass!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_TACTICALVIEW_1|||[m:default]Did you know you can hold {binding:TacticalView} to switch to tactical view?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_TACTICALVIEW_2|||[m:pondering]It can be helpful when there is too much going on in battle.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_TACTICALVIEW_3|||Give it a try sometime!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INFO_1|||[m:default]Did you know you can hold down {binding:Examine} on a unit to see its movement + attack range?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_INFO_2|||If you're trying to stay out of range of a dangerous enemy, this is useful information to have!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_COMBAT_1|||[m:default]You know most of the time good tactics are just basic math!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_COMBAT_2|||Check your basic attack's damage and the HP of enemies in your range
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_COMBAT_3|||[m:angry]Taking out 1 baddie means removing a whole turn for the enemy!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_COMBAT_4|||Be efficient with your attacks!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_TURNORDER_1|||[m:angry]Turn order matters!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_TURNORDER_2|||[m:default]If an enemy has already taken its turn, focus on killing one that hasn't!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_TURNORDER_3|||Removing enemies before they attack means losing less life. [m:mocking]Duh!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_BACKSTAB_1|||[m:default]You know attacking enemies from behind deals more damage right?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_BACKSTAB_2|||Well specifically that damage bonus is +25% of the attack's damage rounded up.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_BACKSTAB_3|||[m:happy]Understanding that might come in handy when taking out enemies with a single attack!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_DRAFTING_1|||[m:default]It's usually smart to avoid drafting abilities in the same mana range.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_DRAFTING_2|||Having too many big cost abilities means waiting multiple turns to cast them.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_DRAFTING_3|||It's ideal to have a range of unique abilities at different mana costs.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_REWARDS_1|||[m:default]Sometimes it seems good to avoid finishing combat to pick up a few more coins...
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_REWARDS_2|||Or healing up your team a bit more... [m:angry]Well the Gods frown upon it!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_REWARDS_3|||[m:default]Turns out, the quicker you finish a combat the more rewards you will gain.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_REWARDS_4|||[m:happy]It's true, that's how I got this gold tooth!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_DISORDERS_1|||[m:sad]Gaining Disorders can feel like a real kick in the nuts sometimes.

NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_HARD_1|||[m:default]Did you realize taking the hard path not only gives better items, but it also levels your cats up more?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_HARD_2|||Every battle levels up a cat, and the hard paths all feature an extra fight!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_HARD_3|||[m:shocked]That's 3 more levels you could be gaining if you take all 3 hard paths!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_HARD_4|||[m:default]You don't always need to take the hard path, especially if you are getting trashed.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_HARD_5|||[m:happy]But you know what they say, no risk, no reward!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_LESSCATS_1|||[m:default]You know you don't always NEED to have 4 cats in your party...

NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_WELLROUNDED_3|||[m:default]Abilities fall into 4 major categories. Offensive, defensive, movement and misc.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_WELLROUNDED_4|||It's usually important for your cats to have one of each so their build is more well rounded.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_WELLROUNDED_5|||[m:happy]Dealing damage is fun, but being able to move around and block will help you not die.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_HEADHOME_1|||[m:default]If your cats are looking trashed after a boss fight, there is no shame in heading home!

NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_ELEMENTS_3|||[m:happy]An ability with water element will put out fires with ease, or even grow grass!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_ELEMENTS_4|||Cold element can slow things down, but wet things will get frozen solid!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_ELEMENTS_5|||[m:default]There are tons of elemental combos to play with.  Experimentation is key!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_REORIENT_1|||Have you ever wanted to put your ass into the face of your enemy?

NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TIPS_MAGICDAMAGE_4|||It's simple!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_1|||[m:questioning]I assume you noticed the extremely large cat roaming the city, consuming felines?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_2|||[m:default]Yeah that's Tina, [b]Guillotina[/b].

NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_4|||I taught her that move... Yeah,
She was one of mine.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_5|||[m:default]She had this thing about consuming her victims...
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_6|||[m:grossedout]Caressing their flesh like a lover would as she devoured them.

NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_11|||[m:angry]You'll need at least 4 high-level [o:black][c:white][img:retired]retired[/c][/o] cats to put up a fight with her.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_12|||[m:happy]She doesn't have any weakness, [m:angry]so just try and hit her hard and often!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_TINA1_13|||[m:winking]Oh, and try to stay out of her stomach!

NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_PYRO_2|||[m:default]I was looting his lab last night and found proof.
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_PYRO_3|||[m:questioning]And guess what he was doing with the failed experiments?
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_PYRO_4|||[m:paranoid]Dumping them down a hole in his lab.  Pretty sure it connects to that old bunker...
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_PYRO_5|||[m:shocked]I also discovered his last human experiments revolved around these conjoined twins!
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_PYRO_6|||[m:shocked]Identical twins attached at the cheek!
Totaly wild stuff...
NPC_BUTCH_BUTCH_PYRO_7|||[m:default]Oh, also pretty sure that giant monster is coming to kill you...

NPC_ORGANGRINDER_ORGAN_UPGRADE4_3|||[m:sad]He's getting too dry and sticky... I like my piles fresh and wet.
NPC_ORGANGRINDER_ORGAN_UPGRADE4_4|||[m:bored]And it's probably TMI,  but.. he just lays there...

NPC_ORGANGRINDER_ORGAN_UPGRADE5_4|||[m:questioning]Do you see it?

[m:questioning]And guess what I'm in charge of!?
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_6|||[m:veryhappy][s:1.6][a:shake]DIFFICULTY![/a][/s]
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_7|||[m:default]See all those icons over there?  That's an options screen.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_8|||[m:pondering]Click an arrow and that zone of the game gets harder.
[m:happy]Simple.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_9|||[m:questioning]But why would you do that you ask?
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_10|||[m:default]Well beyond proving to your friends and family that you are smart and worthy of love...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_11|||[m:default]When you complete the game on "Hard", not only do you gain achievements you also get more [m:veryhappy]in-game unlocks!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_12|||[m:bored]And if you pussy out, just lower it.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_13|||[m:winking]You can also resummon old house bosses too!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_14|||[m:happy]If you set their difficulty harder and kill 'em, they yield neat rewards!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_15|||Anyway, that's about it.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_16|||That is until the DLC...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_17|||[m:angry]Where I become a final boss!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_18|||[m:veryangry][a:shake][s:1.3]And fcuk your shit up![/a][/s]
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_INTRODUCTION_19|||[m:happy]Bye!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_RESUMMON_1|||Huh?...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_1|||[m:shocked]NO ONE EXPECTS THE STEVEN ENDING!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_2|||[m:winking]Pretty cool, huh? Bet you didn't see that one coming!?
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_3|||[m:happy]That doctor's got the IQ of a baked potato now!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_4|||[m:bored]...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_5|||[m:angry]No need to get all emotional about it.  He was the bad guy, right?
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_6|||[m:pondering]Right?? I mean, either way he wasn't very likeable...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_7|||[m:questioning]I'll be honest, I wasn't paying a lot of attention, but I'm sure as hell not the villain of this story!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_8|||[m:angry]I just got here man! If anything, you did way more bad things than me!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_9|||[m:bored]I'm not here to argue with you! We can both agree the ending was fine, let's move on!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_10|||[m:angry]Whatever, it's just a game man!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_11|||[m:paranoid]Speaking of that... I was snooping around the files and I swear to God I saw pieces of a DLC in there...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_12|||[m:pondering]I mean think about it, there are so many loose ends!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_13|||[m:default]Like you for example!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_14|||[m:veryhappy]THAT WAS A JOKE AT YOUR EXPENSE, BUDDY! I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR BEAN HOLE!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_POSTENDGAME_15|||[m:winking]See you at 100%!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_100_1|||[m:bored]Oh wow...

NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_100_2|||[m:veryhappy]A number almost as round as you, tubby!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_100_3|||[m:winking]See you in the next save!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_CRAZY_1|||[m:veryhappy]Well look at you,
video game wizard!!!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_CRAZY_2|||[m:winking]How was that hit of dopamine!? Invigorating ain't it?
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_CRAZY_3|||[m:happy]Well there is more where that came from, buddy! I got shitloads of ways to get high back here...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_CRAZY_4|||Try this one out for size, it's called "Crazy Mode!"
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_CRAZY_5|||[m:shocked]AND IT'S GONNA GET YOU SO LOADED!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_CRAZY_6|||[m:default]Give it a go! More rewards! More dopamine! More brain melting hardships!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_IMPOSSIBLE_1|||[m:default]Well as you probably expected there is another mode harder than Crazy.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_IMPOSSIBLE_2|||[m:shocked]It's called...
"Impossible"!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_IMPOSSIBLE_3|||[m:winking]I call it that because you probably won't beat it, because it's impossible.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_IMPOSSIBLE_4|||[m:bored]Obviously...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT1_IMPOSSIBLE_5|||[m:happy]Have fun!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_HARD_1|||[m:paranoid]Guess what!?
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_HARD_2|||[m:veryhappy]You unlocked Hard Mode for Act 2!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_HARD_3|||[m:default]That's the desert one...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_HARD_4|||[m:happy]Spoiler... this game features 3 acts! So hold on to your butts!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_HARD_5|||Bye!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_CRAZY_1|||[m:worried]Man, you look light headed, maybe you should sit down.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_CRAZY_2|||All this video game playing is really doing a number on you...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_CRAZY_3|||[m:pondering]What I mean is you look like shit. All sweaty, flabby and generally weird...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_CRAZY_4|||[m:bored]You are ugly and no one likes you!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_CRAZY_5|||[m:veryhappy]HAHAHAHA!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_CRAZY_6|||[m:default]Oh, also you unlocked
"Crazy Mode" on this act.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_IMPOSSIBLE_1|||Oh OK, you did something!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_IMPOSSIBLE_2|||[m:pondering]Man, you must have a lot of time on your hands!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_IMPOSSIBLE_3|||[m:winking]And by the looks of you, you probably got a lot of something else on your hands as well.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_IMPOSSIBLE_4|||[m:veryhappy]HA! Gotcha, bitch!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_IMPOSSIBLE_5|||[m:happy]Here, let me unlock
"Impossible Mode" for you on this act.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT2_IMPOSSIBLE_6|||Enjoy, pervert!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_1|||[m:shocked]OMG, YOU UNLOCKED HARD MODE FOR ACT 3!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_2|||[m:default]Someone should throw you a party or something!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_3|||Speaking of, I hear it's your birthday today...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_4|||[m:shocked]!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_5|||[m:pondering]Well chances are it's not, but on the odd chance it was, I thought it would be a funny thing to say.
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_6|||[m:default]Like imagine if it was your birthday and I said that.  Your mind would have been blown!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_7|||Isn't that right, David!?
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_8|||[m:shocked]!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_9|||[m:winking]Now imagine if your name was David!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_HARD_10|||[m:happy]GL!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_CRAZY_1|||You unlocked Crazy Mode for Act 3.  Think you can handle it?!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_CRAZY_2|||[m:veryangry]Oh yeah... HANDLE THIS!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_CRAZY_3|||!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_CRAZY_4|||[m:happy]At this point I'd reach through the screen and knock your fcukin' ass out!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_CRAZY_5|||[m:veryangry]But they didn't add that animation option, so I'm just stuck here in this angry loop!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_CRAZY_6|||Lazy devs...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_CRAZY_7|||...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_IMPOSSIBLE_1|||[m:happy]OK, this is the last one. Act 3: Impossible!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_IMPOSSIBLE_2|||[m:veryhappy]Fun fact: YOU CAN'T WIN!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_IMPOSSIBLE_3|||[m:happy]It's totally untested! The developers just added it to fcuk with you!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_IMPOSSIBLE_4|||[m:questioning]So if you can't beat it, no judgment... you'll just have that achievement locked forever...
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_IMPOSSIBLE_5|||[m:angry]Every time you open the game it will be there haunting you! Taunting you! Teasing and harassing your loser brain!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_IMPOSSIBLE_6|||[m:veryangry]IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN DUDE! It's like a Lost Delirium run without the Holy Mantle unlocked!
NPC_STEVEN_STEVEN_UNLOCK_ACT3_IMPOSSIBLE_7|||[m:bored]It's not gonna happen dude!
//tink_progression|||
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_1|||[m:shocked]Um, why are you in my house?!
NPC_TINK_UNKNOWN_1|||You appear to have unlocked something, but I don't have dialog for it. Congrats. Also fix this.
NPC_TINK_ALSO_1|||Also...
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_1|||[m:happy]Well hello there!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_2|||[m:default]You are the talk of the town these days.  Everyone is all like...
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_3|||[m:pondering]"There goes that so and so, aren't they a catch!?[m:happy] They got brains and buns!"
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_4|||[m:questioning]And I'm like
"Thanks girl, but did you hear about that newbie in town who's been hoarding all those cats!?"
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_5|||[m:pondering]And then they are all
"Yeah yeah, I heard about them."
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_6|||[m:questioning]"But what's this I hear about that book deal you landed?"
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_7|||[m:angry]and I'm all
"Leave me alone, stalker!"
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_8|||[m:happy]LOL!
Gosh, people today are so nosy right!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_9|||[m:default][a:wave]ANNNYWAY![/a]
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_10|||What's this about you and me being pipe buddies?
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_11|||[m:whispering]You know I can hear you talking in your sleep through that thing, right?
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_12|||[m:mocking]You ol' perv!
My wife made me cover the pipe with a quilt, she was so embarrassed!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_13|||[m:questioning]But listen...
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_14|||[m:sad]I need a baby...
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_15|||[m:sad]I have this empty hole in my heart.
See, my wife and I, we can't have children of our own...
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_16|||[m:questioning]So we have decided to start a cat family, and guess who the father is!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_17|||[m:veryhappy]IT'S YOU, SILLY!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_18|||[m:default]Just send me your kittens and I'm sure I can find a way to return the favor.
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_19|||[m:angry]But try to not send me any uggos...
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_20|||[m:veryangry]Keep your donkey-faced fuggos in the basement!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BEGIN_ACCEPTING_CATS_21|||[m:default]Toodles!
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_1|||[m:veryhappy]Oh happy day!
My little heart is so full!
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_2|||[m:happy]Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You have no idea how much this little guy means to us!
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_3|||[m:pondering]About your payment...
I'm a bit at a loss here...
Hmm.
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_4|||[m:default]Um, here.
Take this little bow I guess.
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_5|||It may seem useless now,
but in the right light, the color is just to die for!
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_6|||[m:happy]Seriously this bow could make God cry!
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_7|||[m:angry]Don't you dare throw it away!
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_8|||[m:angry]. . .
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_9|||[m:mocking]You can leave now...
NPC_TINK_TINK_PRETTYBOW_10|||[m:happy]Oh, but don't forget to keep sending me kittens! Toodles!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_1|||[m:default]Hey you!
My wife and I were just talking about how grateful we are for all your help.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_2|||Sadly, she just left.  But since she's gone we can go over some guy stuff.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_3|||[m:questioning]So you know how we all just love to categorize and organize everything?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_4|||[m:default]Well I was recently watching some videos about that and discovered something!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_5|||You know when you select a cat in your house and it shows all its info to the left?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_6|||Well, if you click that thing by its name, you can assign a shape to it!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_7|||[m:whispering]I use the poopy shape quite often, you know, so I can remember what kittens are the ugly ones.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_8|||[m:winking]That way I can quickly move them back to the basement when they escape!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TAGS_9|||[m:default]No need to thank me,
just keep sending me those kittens!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_1|||[m:veryhappy]OMG GURL,
did you see my new car outside?
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_2|||My wife just got that for me for our 13 year anniversary!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_3|||[m:mocking]What can I say...
I'm just a spoiled prince!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_4|||[m:default]All these kittens you keep sending are seriously scoring me points!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_5|||[m:happy]This time, as payment I'm going to fill you in on something cool.
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_6|||[m:default]From here on out, when you check your cat's info, you'll also see their Base and Bonus stats!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_7|||Base stats are what your cats will pass down to their kittens, you know, their DNA.
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_8|||[m:pondering]Bonus stats are modifiers.  Kittens wont inherit these at all... they are just, you know...
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_9|||[m:pondering]Like, if they got a totally gross dog face or if they got some botox recently.
those are the + and - numbers!
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_10|||[m:questioning]I don't know how better to explain it...
Just go look for yourself.
NPC_TINK_TINK_BASESTATS_11|||[m:mocking]When you are built like this, you don't need to know "NUMBERS"!
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_1|||[m:happy]Speak of the devil!
I was just thinking about you!
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_2|||[m:pondering]See, I was doing some research, you know,
on ugly people.
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_3|||[m:shocked]And I discovered this thing called "Inbreeding",
and it's totally nasty!
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_4|||[m:questioning]So it's like when you kiss your brother and get goosebumps!
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_5|||[m:scared]It's like that, but the goosebumps are huge and throbbing and your brother has no pants!
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_6|||[m:pondering]Wait, no.  I'm telling this wrong...
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_7|||[m:default]What I'm saying is there is a new smiley face emote on your cats info screen.
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_8|||If you'd swipe left on that emote... [m:paranoid]your cat is probably inbred... Ew.
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_9|||[m:angry]Inbred cats are not only super fuggs, but their bodies can get all wonky!
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_10|||[m:veryangry]NOT GOOD!
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_11|||[a:wave][m:happy]ANNNNNYYWAY![/a]
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_12|||[m:default]So that's a thing to check now, I guess?
NPC_TINK_TINK_INBREEDING_13|||[m:happy]Keep sending those kittens!
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_1|||[m:happy]. . .
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_2|||[m:angry]Well...?!
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_3|||[m:veryangry]Aren't you going to say something nice about my new shirt?!
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_4|||MY GAWD!
I'm so sick of rude people!
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_5|||[m:angry]Why can't people just get past their insecurities and compliment me!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_6|||Get over yourself!
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_7|||[m:default]Whatever...
How can I stay mad at the baby daddy of all my kitties!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_8|||[m:questioning]So, have you ever wanted to know if someone is a huge moody biotch, just by looking at them?
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_9|||[m:mocking]God knows I have...
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_10|||[m:happy]Well, now you can!
Just check your cat's info tab and you can see if its an agro nut-ball or not!
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_11|||[m:angry]. . .
NPC_TINK_TINK_AGGRESSION_12|||You can leave now...
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_1|||[m:default]Have you ever heard of the term "[b]gaydar[/b]"?
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_2|||[m:pondering]It's this innate sense people have where they can instantly tell if someone is queer.
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_3|||[m:happy]Even from 50 feet away!
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_4|||[m:default]Well, I myself have that ability, and as payment for your kittens, I bestow it upon you!
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_5|||[m:happy]From here on out, you will instantly know if your cats are Gay, Straight, Bi...
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_6|||[m:pondering]Pan, Demi, Poly, Andro, Auto, Feebis, Beepis, Gyne, Mono, Gray, Cetero, Multi or even Curious!
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_7|||[m:confused]Well maybe not all that, but def the first three...
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_8|||[m:mocking]And I know what you are wondering, and yes, my wife is Str8!!
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_9|||So don't you be getting any ideas!
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_10|||[m:shocked]Oh, I think I hear her pulling up... Get the hell out of here!
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_11|||[m:scared]I don't need her assuming anything.  She can be quite territorial.
NPC_TINK_TINK_SEXUALITY_12|||[m:shocked]GET OUT!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_1|||[m:veryhappy]Our home is overflowing with love!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_2|||Thank you sooo much!
I can't tell you how happy we are to have such a giant fur family!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_3|||[m:angry]I just wish our neighbors would mind their damn business!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_4|||I swear they have it out for me! We have had the county visit twice this month!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_5|||I can't help it if our children wander into their house and crap all over their kitchen table!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_6|||[m:happy]. . .
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_7|||[m:veryhappy]I'm lying, it was me... I shit on their table!
Tee hee.
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_8|||[m:mocking]That's what they get for calling the county the first time!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_9|||[m:veryangry]THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM, BILL!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_10|||[m:whispering]I've been eating tons of Pinky Winkies...
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_11|||[a:wave][m:happy]ANNNNYWAY![/a]
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_12|||[m:default]Speaking of people I wish would...
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_13|||[m:veryangry]DIE OF A HEART ATTACK ON TOP OF THEIR WIFE!
KILLING THEM BOTH!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_14|||[m:default]You can now tell who your cats hate!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_15|||[m:inlove]You can also tell who they are in love with...
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_16|||[m:default]For me, that would be...
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_17|||[m:veryangry]MY WIFE! NOT YOU, BILL! MY WIFE!!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_18|||[m:angry]GAWD!
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_19|||[m:shocked]Anyway, I gotta use the little girl's room...
NPC_TINK_TINK_RELATIONSHIPS_20|||[m:winking]Toodles!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_1|||[m:pondering]Listen sister, don't tell the boys... But I'm all out of tea...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_2|||[m:shocked]I'm literally drained of gossip! GAH!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_3|||[m:scared]I'm a fraud!
And everyone is going to find out!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_4|||[m:sad]My wife will never be able to look me in the face again!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_5|||[m:shocked]If she leaves me, I'm ruined! Who will spoil me!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_6|||[m:scared]This can't be the fate of Ferguson Rodney Tinkles!!!!!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_7|||[m:paranoid]!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_8|||OK, what's it going to take for you to keep those lips zipped!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_9|||[m:angry]Extortion is it?
[m:pondering]Well I can't say I don't respect the hustle, girl...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_10|||[m:default]A true boss bitch!
OK, so how's 25 bucks sound?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_11|||[m:questioning]Will that keep you from tattling about my shortcomings?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX_INTRO_12|||[m:default]OK, deal!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX1_1|||[m:angry]Oh I see your game... Keep sending me cats so you can blackmail me into a steady income flow?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX1_2|||[m:pondering]Well played girl...
Well played...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX1_3|||[m:default]Here's your hush money! $25 as per our agreement.
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX1_4|||[m:angry]Now get out of here!!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX2_1|||[m:scared]Please stop sending me kittens...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX2_2|||My wife is going to eventually notice the missing cash!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX2_3|||[m:angry]You are a real sicko, you know that!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX2_4|||Fine! Take this 25 bucks! I WAS going to spend it on something nice for the wife!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX2_5|||[m:sad]But I guess lingerie is off the table tonight...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX2_6|||[m:angry]I had my eyes on this skin-tight pink leather number, but I guess that little dream is over!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX2_7|||[m:veryangry]Thanks for ruining my life!!!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX3_1|||[m:angry]Yeah yeah, I know the routine...
Heres $25!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX3_2|||[m:veryangry]NOW DON'T LET ME SEE YOUR FACE AROUND MY HOUSE AGAIN!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX3_3|||[m:scared]My wife is going to kill me... I can't keep sneaking money from her purse forever!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX3_4|||[m:winking]Maybe there is something else I can pay you with?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX3_5|||[m:shocked]???
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX3_6|||[m:veryangry]FINE! YOUR LOSS!
I WAS JOKING ANYWAY!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_1|||[m:happy]You know I've been looking into you!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_2|||[m:winking]Maybe it's time the blackmailer becomes the blackmailee!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_3|||[m:happy]Yes, it's true! I know your secret identity! And if you don't want me to spill those beans, its gonna cost ya!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_4|||[m:winking]25 big ones! Hahaha! Checkmate ya old bitch!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_5|||[m:shocked]!!!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_6|||You are raising your price!?!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_7|||[m:veryangry]TO $100!!!? THAT'S INSANE!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_8|||[m:shocked]INFLATION!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_9|||[m:angry]FINE! HERE! TAKE YOUR $25! BUT I'M WARNING YOU!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX4_10|||[m:veryangry]YOUR TIME IS COMING! WATCH YOUR BACK!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX5_1|||[m:pondering]You know, I looked into this blackmail scheme you got me locked into...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX5_2|||[m:questioning]Were you aware it's 100% illegal!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX5_3|||[m:veryangry]YOU ARE GOING TO JAIL BUDDY!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX5_4|||[m:angry]But until then, here is that 25 bucks I owe you!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX6_1|||[m:paranoid]Listen, my wife has been asking about her missing cash...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX6_2|||I think she's on to us... Can you like, slow down on the kittens?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX6_3|||[m:scared]I told her I'm using the money on botox but eventually this youthful mug will fade...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX6_4|||And then I'm really screwed!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX6_5|||[m:angry]Take the money, but cool it on the cats!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX7_1|||[m:pondering]You know, I was thinking 25 bucks to keep you quiet feels a bit high...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX7_2|||[m:questioning]I'm thinking we drop it to like $5? That feels fair to me...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX7_3|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX7_4|||[m:angry]Seriously! $25 is like 10 bucks a cat or whatever!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX7_5|||Listen! I'm not some math nerd like you! I spent my time at school kissing girls and mocking the ugly and bewildered!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX7_6|||[m:veryangry]WHATEVER! HERE! GO SPEND IT ON A DIET BOOK YOU LUMP OF HOG LARD!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX8_1|||[m:winking]You know, I'm starting to think this whole extortion thing is just an excuse for you to talk to me...
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX8_2|||[m:pondering]I got this theory.  Everyone I know either wants to be me, or be inside me!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX8_3|||Not sure which one of those you are yet... [m:angry]Maybe both!? Jealous much!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX8_4|||Here.. take the money, but this is the last time!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX9_1|||[m:veryangry]WHAT!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX9_2|||[m:angry]Listen, I'm very busy with lots of important things right now!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX9_3|||Take the 25 bucks, whatever!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX9_4|||God, I'm so over you!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX9_5|||[m:veryangry]STOP INTERRUPTING ME!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_1|||[m:scared]This has to stop, for reals!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_2|||[m:questioning]All I hear these days is
"Where is my 25 bucks Ferguson!?"
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_3|||"[m:angry]ALL MY MONEY IS GONE AGAIN, FERGUSON!"
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_4|||"I'M LATE ON THE MORTGAGE AGAIN FERGUSON!"
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_5|||[m:veryangry]"STOP GETTING LIP FILLER AND LIPO FERGUSON!"
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_6|||[m:angry]The nagging is never ending!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_7|||I swear I'd be pulling my hair out, but we both know I cant afford plugs again!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_8|||[m:veryangry]STOP SENDING ME KITTENS!
NPC_TINK_TINK_MAX10_9|||PLEASE!
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_A_1|||Oh, it's you again!
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_A_2|||[m:happy]Ready for some hot gossip?
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_B_1|||[m:questioning]I think someone has a crush on me!
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_B_2|||Ok gurl, let me spill the tea...
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_C_1|||[m:happy]Well someone is in need of a makeover!
Let's chat!
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_D_1|||[m:mocking]Well look who just can't get enough of me! Now, listen up!
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_E_1|||[m:veryhappy]I'm so happy to see you! I assume you want more gossip?
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_F_1|||Yep, still here! It's like I never leave this damn RV these days.
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_F_2|||Now listen honey...
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_G_1|||[m:shocked]Gah, you spooked me! Were you watching me do my makeup?
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_G_2|||It's just coverup for my scar.  So nosy! Want a tip?
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_H_1|||[m:scared]If you keep dropping by like this people are going to get the wrong idea about us!
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_H_2|||[m:default]I did have some information for you, so lend me your ear.
NPC_TINK_UNPROMPTED_I_1|||[m:angry]Oh it's you. Let's cut to it, I'm in a mood today...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INTRO_1|||[m:mocking]So your house is filthy and your cats are all donked up, I assume?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INTRO_2|||[m:happy]Well don't you worry your pretty little head. Tink is here for you!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INTRO_3|||I have loads of hot gossip just oozing from my veins!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INTRO_4|||[m:default]So let me keep you in the loop...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_COMFORT_1|||[m:default]See this thing? [img:comfort] That icon is Comfort!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_COMFORT_2|||High Comfort[img:comfort] is vital for your kitties.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_COMFORT_3|||A low Comfort[img:comfort] will not only prevent breeding, [m:scared]but it can cause serious aggression!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_COMFORT_4|||[m:happy]Keep that Comfort[img:comfort] stat high and your cats will breed like rabbits!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_STIMULATION_1|||[m:default]So you know this icon?
[img:stimulation] That's Stimulation.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_STIMULATION_2|||[m:pondering]It's supposed to be a yarn ball or something?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_STIMULATION_3|||[m:default]High Stimulation[img:stimulation] is needed if you want your kittens to inherit things from their parents.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_STIMULATION_4|||Base stats and even the abilities of your cats can be passed down as long as your Stimulation[img:stimulation] is high enough.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_STIMULATION_5|||So if a father is 7 and a mother is a 3, a big Stimulation[img:stimulation] number will ensure their offspring are also 7's!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_STIMULATION_6|||[m:sad]And not nasty uggos like their mother...
[a:shake]*shudders*[/a]
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_STIMULATION_7|||[m:happy]Every good breeder puts a heavy focus on Stimulation[img:stimulation], so don't neglect it!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_APPEAL_1|||[m:default]Ever notice this [img:appeal] icon above your house? That's your house's Appeal.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_APPEAL_2|||[m:questioning]Appeal[img:appeal] makes your house,
well more appealing I guess?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_APPEAL_3|||[m:default]The higher your Appeal[img:appeal], the better the strays are that appear each day!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_APPEAL_4|||Don't sleep on Appeal[img:appeal]!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_HEALTH_1|||[m:default][img:health], that thing is a Health icon!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_HEALTH_2|||A room with Health[img:health] has a chance to heal wounds, and even cure diseases!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_HEALTH_3|||The higher the Health[img:health], the better those odds are.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_HEALTH_4|||[m:scared]but the opposite is also true. Low Health[img:health] can actually cause disease too!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_HEALTH_5|||[m:default]So be careful!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MUTATION_1|||[m:default]Here is a rare one, [img:evolution]! That's the Mutation icon!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MUTATION_2|||[m:mocking]This thing will do wonders on your skin!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MUTATION_3|||[m:default]Rooms with Mutation[img:evolution] have a chance to mutate the cats inside!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MUTATION_4|||[m:happy]Need an extra hand around the house? Maybe you can grow one!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_CLEANING_1|||[m:angry]Clean your house!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_CLEANING_2|||Poops and dead cats actually lower your Comfort[img:comfort]
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_CLEANING_3|||and it's also just really freakin' gross!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_CLEANING_4|||[m:veryangry]Wash yourself, gurl!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_BASESTATS_1|||[m:default]Base stats are important for breeding.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_BASESTATS_2|||When you breed cats, their base stats are what their kittens can inherit.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_BASESTATS_3|||[m:mocking]Ignore any bonus modifiers, base stats are the only stat that matters for breeding!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MULTICLASSING_1|||[m:default]Rooms with high Stimulation[img:stimulation] can often times yield kittens with class abilities!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MULTICLASSING_2|||[m:happy]You realize what that means!? Multiclassing!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MULTICLASSING_3|||[m:veryhappy]Mages with Fighter abilities!
Tanks with Thief movement!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MULTICLASSING_4|||[m:scared]I realize how nerdy that just sounded...
Sorry, my ex was a
"dungeon master".
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_MULTICLASSING_5|||[m:sad]The things a girl will do in college to get attention...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INBREEDING_1|||[m:default]Inbreeding may sound cool,[m:angry] but it's not!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INBREEDING_2|||Just because it has the word breeding in the name, doesn't instantly make it cool!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INBREEDING_3|||[m:shocked]Inbred cats can be born with seriously bad birth defects!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INBREEDING_4|||[m:whispering]And you know what that means...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TIPS_INBREEDING_5|||[m:paranoid]U G L Y !
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_1|||[m:scared]I was driving past Pinky Winkies today and swear to God, I saw that fat cat's head rolling through the street!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_2|||[m:questioning]You know that morbidly obese one with the vore fetish you murdered last month? That one.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_3|||[m:shocked]Then, out of nowhere, her giant blubber body comes flopping its way down the street, after the head!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_4|||[m:sad]I tried to take a pic but my camera roll was totally full...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_5|||[m:happy]I was doing glamor shots with the ol' ball n' chain last night and it got a little cray-cray.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_6|||[m:winking]I was going to delete a few pics to make room but got caught up in how amazing I was looking last night.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_7|||[m:angry]Then this guy in a bandit mask flipped me off and yelled in this very aggressive tone!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_8|||[m:shocked]I was all... WTF!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_9|||[m:sad]I tried to show him the pics and he just ignored me and kept honking his horn along with like 7 other people!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TINA2_10|||[m:angry]What the hell is wrong with everyone these days!?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_1|||[m:paranoid]So I don't wanna like freak you out or whatever...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_2|||But this big nude cat with multiple guns and an Austrian accent came by my place last night.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_3|||[m:pondering]He said he was looking for you, something about murder.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_4|||[m:questioning]Something something, terminate?
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_5|||[m:shocked]Then he just started pop locking.  Like busting out the robot right there in front of me.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_6|||[m:happy]I had my wife turn on some James Brown and that man broke it down!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_7|||[m:default]We danced 'till dawn and he just kinda wandered off.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_8|||[m:questioning]He said something about "being back", so if I were you I'd split town.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_9|||[m:default]You could start a new life somewhere! I got some extra wigs if you need them.
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_10|||[m:happy]If I ever split this poop hole, I'd call myself Ms. Tinkle Toes!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_11|||[m:mocking]Just another tall drink of water trying to make it in a man's world!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_12|||[m:veryhappy]Homemaker by day, street walker by night!
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_13|||[m:happy]My double life would have so many twists and turns, your nipples would turn purple...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_14|||[m:sad]... sigh ...
NPC_TINK_TINK_TERMINATOR_15|||One day...

NPC_TRACY_UNPROMPTED_1|||[m:happy]Welcome to P Mart,
where our love for your pets is never ending...
NPC_TRACY_UNPROMPTED_2|||Are you in need of pet supplies for your fur babies? [m:default]
ugh...
NPC_TRACY_ALSO_1|||Also...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_1|||[m:bored]Yeah yeah,
I see you.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_2|||I'm Tracy,
but I honestly don't feel a word can fully represent who I am as a person, so don't bother using it.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_3|||[m:questioning]So you must think you're some type of pet lover?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_4|||[m:default]I assume you identify as a "pet lover" by how you carry yourself?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_5|||[m:angry]Well?!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_6|||[m:default]Yeah I thought so.
[b]"Pet Lover"[/b]
God, that term is so speciesist.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_7|||[m:angry]Even hearing the word, "PET"!
It just makes my skin crawl.
I prefer the term, animal companion.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_8|||[m:pondering]But personally, I go a step beyond loving animals.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_9|||[m:default]In fact, I believe all animals should have the same rights as us.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_10|||[m:pondering]If not more!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_11|||[m:angry]Even the term [b]pet[/b] showcases the bigoted speciesist agenda that this sick world subscribes to.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_12|||[m:veryangry]If I had my way, using that word would be punishable by death!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_INTRODUCTION_13|||[m:shocked]!

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_1|||[m:bored]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_2|||[m:default]They are sending us another idol.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_3|||It gets here tomorrow...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_4|||[m:bored]I'm not sure what the hell you are doing with those things...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_5|||[m:angry]But I don't like it!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_6|||[m:pondering]Now I don't know what kind of God you worship...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_7|||[m:angry]But if it's the one that I don't like, I'm gonna be pissed!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL3_8|||[m:veryangry]AND I THINK WE BOTH KNOW WHAT ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT!

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_1|||[m:happy][b]Welcome to P Mart. Did you know today we have a sale on...[/b]
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_2|||[m:bored]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_3|||Another idol is being stocked tomorrow... This is getting a bit creepy.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_4|||[m:questioning]Why do you keep ordering these things?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_5|||[m:default]Don't you remember that episode of that show where the kids found an idol...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_6|||And they start experiencing horrible misfortune while it's in their possession!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_7|||[m:shocked]Alice injured her back and Greg was in a horrible surfing accident!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_8|||[m:mocking]Imagine all the misfortune that will befall you!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_9|||[m:happy]Like maybe you'll die in a horrible car accident on the way home today?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL4_10|||[m:veryhappy]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL5_1|||[m:happy][b]P Mart wants to dispel the rumors that the tainted meat found in the storage lockers behind Pinky Winkies was in any way associated with this
P Mart chain.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL5_2|||[b]The collars, pet microchips and name tags discovered in their ground beef is purely coincidental.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL5_3|||[b]And all rumors are just that, rumors.[/b]
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL5_4|||[b]P Mart will take legal action against anyone spreading said rumors and takes these allegations very seriously.[/b]

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL5_7|||[m:sad]ugh...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_1|||[m:bored]Another idol goes up for sale tomorrow.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_2|||At this point, I assume you know you are the only one buying these things.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_3|||[m:default]Only a total psycho would obsessively collect stuff like this...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_4|||[m:shocked]And I don't mean that in an ableist way at all.  Don't get me wrong.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_5|||[m:questioning]I'm using psycho in a derogatory sense. If you were truly a psychopath, I wouldn't dare.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_6|||[m:default]If anything, I'd complement you on your contributions to society...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_7|||[m:pondering]Plenty of people in prominent job fields are psychos... like CEOs for example.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_8|||...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_9|||No wait, I hate those people too, hmm. Ummmm...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_10|||[m:angry]Ugh, whatever. Listen, someone honked while I was walking to work and it threw my whole day.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL6_11|||I can't even think anymore...
Leave me alone!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_1|||[m:happy]So guess what!?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_2|||Tomorrow is the last time I'll be stocking any more of those stupid idols!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_3|||[m:veryhappy]That's right.  The company that made them went out of business last month!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_4|||[m:mocking]Coincidentally, around the same time, they received a very strongly worded letter.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_5|||[m:happy]A scathing correspondence explaining in great detail the harm they are causing.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_6|||"Your companies eco-footprint is like a steel-toed boot to the face of mother nature."
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_7|||[m:happy]That was just one of the many thoughtful and incredibly well written zingers my letter featured.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_8|||[m:scared]The letter featured...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_9|||[m:happy]OK, it was me!
You got me!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_10|||[m:angry]But what are you gonna do about it, huh!?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_11|||What could you even do to me that you haven't already done to literally thousands of innocent kittens!?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_12|||[m:veryangry]I'M THE GOOD GUY HERE! Wait, no.. I'M THE GOOD PERSON HERE!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_13|||I AM A GOOD PERSON! IT'S ALL OF YOU THAT ARE EVIL!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_14|||WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT? I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL QUIT!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_15|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_16|||[m:questioning]No, tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll quit... and this store will crumble along with everyone in it!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_IDOL7_17|||[m:sad]ugh
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE1_1|||[m:default]Ugh...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE1_2|||[m:happy][b]Hello and thank you for entering the P Mart kitty donation center rewards program.

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE1_5|||[m:default]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE1_6|||Come back tomorrow. I haven't restocked any new imports yet...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE1_7|||[m:questioning]Pretty sure it's some kind of frozen food locker or something.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE1_8|||[m:sad]... ugh ...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE2_1|||[m:happy][b]P Mart wants to thank you personally for all of your hard work!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE2_2|||[b]We have recently expanded into rural parts of China and Africa, Spreading kittens across the globe![/b]
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE2_3|||[m:bored]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE2_4|||[m:default]And that's all I'm required to say...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE2_5|||It appears tomorrows import is yet another meat locker...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE2_6|||[m:winking]Maybe you could find a way to crawl in it and die?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE2_7|||[m:happy]Just an idea...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_1|||[m:happy][b]P Mart wants to remind its customers that the P in its name stands for Paw.[/b]
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_2|||[b]The similarity to any of our competitors is purely coincidental.[/b]

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_4|||[m:bored]. . .
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_5|||[m:default]Yet another food storage unit will be stocked tomorrow.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_6|||[m:questioning]Do you seriously need more food storage?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_7|||[m:angry]Have you maybe thought about donating your excess food to a local animal shelter?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_8|||[m:pondering]. . .
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_9|||[m:shocked]No, I don't know specifically what animal shelters there are around here.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_10|||[m:angry]Oh, am I supposed to work for you now? It's my job to find write-offs for capitalist gains?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_11|||[m:veryangry]Is that it? I'm just an unpaid laborer, free for you to use and abuse as you see fit?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_12|||[m:angry]That's it isn't it?
That's how you get off!?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE3_13|||[m:veryangry][a:shake]DISGUSTING![/a]

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_1|||[m:bored]. . .
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_2|||[m:default]So another food storage unit appeared in the back today...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_3|||[m:questioning]What the hell are you doing with these things, seriously?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_4|||[m:pondering]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_5|||[m:whispering]Are you killing people? Taking them out and putting the bodies in cold storage?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_6|||[m:happy]You can tell me if you are... I mean, like how do you choose 'em?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_7|||[m:happy]If it was me I'd pose as dog of some kind, just kinda lay there and wait.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_8|||Someone would attempt to "rescue" me, but the moment I'm in their house, it's over!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_9|||[m:veryangry][a:shake]"AN ANIMAL CAN'T BE OWNED!"[/a]
I'd yell as I start going to town on 'em all!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_10|||[m:veryhappy]Then I'd grind 'em all up in one of those industrial deals, like the ones Pinky Winkies has.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_11|||[m:happy]And just mix 'em in with the meat...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_12|||[m:veryangry]Let the CONSUMER become the CONSUMED!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE4_13|||[m:veryhappy]HAHAHAHAHA!

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE5_7|||[m:default]You got a new meat locker in the back...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE5_8|||[m:questioning]I'll bring it out tomorrow, I guess.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE5_9|||[m:bored]Whatever...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_1|||[m:default]Another locker appeared in the back today...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_2|||[m:questioning]Are you some kind of prepper? What's the deal with the food lockers?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_3|||[m:default]You know if you need extra storage, that Pinky Winkies downtown has a ton.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_4|||[m:pondering]Hell, I bet you could fit 30+ middle-aged white men in the units they got back there!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_5|||[m:happy]Strip 'em down and you can fit 3 more! Crazy, huh?
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_6|||You wouldn't think khaki slacks and business suits could take up so much space...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_7|||And you can just burn those at the junkyard in an old metal bin.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_8|||[m:shocked]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_9|||[m:angry]I'm just offering you advice! No need to get all uppity about it!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE6_10|||[m:bored]Your wasteful meat cooler will be in stock tomorrow.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_1|||[m:bored]If you think collecting coolers is going to make you cooler, you're wrong.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_2|||[m:happy]Hahaha,
[s:.7]Make you cooler...[/s]
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_3|||[m:pondering]Well I guess if you left them open, you'd become cooler...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_4|||[m:angry]But that's not what I meant, and leaving refrigeration units open is extremely wasteful.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_5|||And terrible for our environment!
That's not something to make light of!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_6|||[m:veryangry]...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_7|||[m:angry]You may assume your laughter is innocent, but mocking things like this not only reinforces bad behavior...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_8|||[m:angry]But it also pumps carbon dioxide into the atmosphere...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_9|||And everyone knows with all the deforestation going on these days...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE7_10|||[m:shocked]Every chuckle could mean ending the life of an innocent animal.

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE8_7|||[m:default]If a middle-aged white man can break out of it, it ain't worth it IMO.
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE8_8|||[m:angry]And I don't care if he chewed off his own hand and nubbed the lock through the bars 'till it unlatched!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE8_9|||Not my problem!

NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE10_9|||[m:happy]But I won't be here!
That's right, I got a job at this new fast food place opening up soon!
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE10_10|||[m:winking]So enjoy your life or whatever! I know I'll be enjoying mine...
NPC_TRACY_TRACY_FOODSTORAGE10_11|||[m:happy]Taking down yet another greedy corporation from the inside.
